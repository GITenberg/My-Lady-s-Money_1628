    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      OLD Lady Lydiard sat meditating by the fireside, with three letters lying
      open on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time had discolored the paper, and had turned the ink to a brownish hue.
      The letters were all addressed to the same person&mdash;&ldquo;THE RT. HON. LORD
      LYDIARD&rdquo;&mdash;and were all signed in the same way&mdash;&ldquo;Your
      affectionate cousin, James Tollmidge.&rdquo; Judged by these specimens of his
      correspondence, Mr. Tollmidge must have possessed one great merit as a
      letter-writer&mdash;the merit of brevity. He will weary nobody&rsquo;s patience,
      if he is allowed to have a hearing. Let him, therefore, be permitted, in
      his own high-flown way, to speak for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>First Letter.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;My statement, as your Lordship requests, shall
      be short and to the point. I was doing very well as a portrait-painter in
      the country; and I had a wife and children to consider. Under the
      circumstances, if I had been left to decide for myself, I should certainly
      have waited until I had saved a little money before I ventured on the
      serious expense of taking a house and studio at the west end of London.
      Your Lordship, I positively declare, encouraged me to try the experiment
      without waiting. And here I am, unknown and unemployed, a helpless artist
      lost in London&mdash;with a sick wife and hungry children, and bankruptcy
      staring me in the face. On whose shoulders does this dreadful
      responsibility rest? On your Lordship&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Second Letter.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;After a week&rsquo;s delay, you favor me, my Lord,
      with a curt reply. I can be equally curt on my side. I indignantly deny
      that I or my wife ever presumed to see your Lordship&rsquo;s name as a means of
      recommendation to sitters without your permission. Some enemy has
      slandered us. I claim as my right to know the name of that enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Third (and last) Letter.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Another week has passed&mdash;and
      not a word of answer has reached me from your Lordship. It matters little.
      I have employed the interval in making inquiries, and I have at last
      discovered the hostile influence which has estranged you from me. I have
      been, it seems, so unfortunate as to offend Lady Lydiard (how, I cannot
      imagine); and the all-powerful influence of this noble lady is now used
      against the struggling artist who is united to you by the sacred ties of
      kindred. Be it so. I can fight my way upwards, my Lord, as other men have
      done before me. A day may yet come when the throng of carriages waiting at
      the door of the fashionable portrait-painter will include her Ladyship&rsquo;s
      vehicle, and bring me the tardy expression of her Ladyship&rsquo;s regret. I
      refer you, my Lord Lydiard, to that day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having read Mr. Tollmidge&rsquo;s formidable assertions relating to herself for
      the second time, Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s meditations came to an abrupt end. She
      rose, took the letters in both hands to tear them up, hesitated, and threw
      them back in the cabinet drawer in which she had discovered them, among
      other papers that had not been arranged since Lord Lydiard&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idiot!&rdquo; said her Ladyship, thinking of Mr. Tollmidge, &ldquo;I never even
      heard of him, in my husband&rsquo;s lifetime; I never even knew that he was
      really related to Lord Lydiard, till I found his letters. What is to be
      done next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked, as she put that question to herself, at an open newspaper
      thrown on the table, which announced the death of &ldquo;that accomplished
      artist Mr. Tollmidge, related, it is said, to the late well-known
      connoisseur, Lord Lydiard.&rdquo; In the next sentence the writer of the
      obituary notice deplored the destitute condition of Mrs. Tollmidge and her
      children, &ldquo;thrown helpless on the mercy of the world.&rdquo; Lady Lydiard stood
      by the table with her eyes on those lines, and saw but too plainly the
      direction in which they pointed&mdash;the direction of her check-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning towards the fireplace, she rang the bell. &ldquo;I can do nothing in
      this matter,&rdquo; she thought to herself, &ldquo;until I know whether the report
      about Mrs. Tollmidge and her family is to be depended on. Has Moody come
      back?&rdquo; she asked, when the servant appeared at the door. &ldquo;Moody&rdquo;
       (otherwise her Ladyship&rsquo;s steward) had not come back. Lady Lydiard
      dismissed the subject of the artist&rsquo;s widow from further consideration
      until the steward returned, and gave her mind to a question of domestic
      interest which lay nearer to her heart. Her favorite dog had been ailing
      for some time past, and no report of him had reached her that morning. She
      opened a door near the fireplace, which led, through a little corridor
      hung with rare prints, to her own boudoir. &ldquo;Isabel!&rdquo; she called out, &ldquo;how
      is Tommie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fresh young voice answered from behind the curtain which closed the
      further end of the corridor, &ldquo;No better, my Lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A low growl followed the fresh young voice, and added (in dog&rsquo;s language),
      &ldquo;Much worse, my Lady&mdash;much worse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard closed the door again, with a compassionate sigh for Tommie,
      and walked slowly to and fro in her spacious drawing-room, waiting for the
      steward&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accurately described, Lord Lydiard&rsquo;s widow was short and fat, and, in the
      matter of age, perilously near her sixtieth birthday. But it may be said,
      without paying a compliment, that she looked younger than her age by ten
      years at least. Her complexion was of that delicate pink tinge which is
      sometimes seen in old women with well-preserved constitutions. Her eyes
      (equally well preserved) were of that hard light blue color which wears
      well, and does not wash out when tried by the test of tears. Add to this
      her short nose, her plump cheeks that set wrinkles at defiance, her white
      hair dressed in stiff little curls; and, if a doll could grow old, Lady
      Lydiard, at sixty, would have been the living image of that doll, taking
      life easily on its journey downwards to the prettiest of tombs, in a
      burial-ground where the myrtles and roses grew all the year round.
    </p>
    <p>
      These being her Ladyship&rsquo;s personal merits, impartial history must
      acknowledge, on the list of her defects, a total want of tact and taste in
      her attire. The lapse of time since Lord Lydiard&rsquo;s death had left her at
      liberty to dress as she pleased. She arrayed her short, clumsy figure in
      colors that were far too bright for a woman of her age. Her dresses,
      badly chosen as to their hues, were perhaps not badly made, but were
      certainly badly worn. Morally, as well as physically, it must be said of
      Lady Lydiard that her outward side was her worst side. The anomalies of
      her dress were matched by the anomalies of her character. There were
      moments when she felt and spoke as became a lady of rank; and there were
      other moments when she felt and spoke as might have become the cook in the
      kitchen. Beneath these superficial inconsistencies, the great heart, the
      essentially true and generous nature of the woman, only waited the
      sufficient occasion to assert themselves. In the trivial intercourse of
      society she was open to ridicule on every side of her. But when a serious
      emergency tried the metal of which she was really made, the people who
      were loudest in laughing at her stood aghast, and wondered what had become
      of the familiar companion of their everyday lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Ladyship&rsquo;s promenade had lasted but a little while, when a man in
      black clothing presented himself noiselessly at the great door which
      opened on the staircase. Lady Lydiard signed to him impatiently to enter
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been expecting you for some time, Moody,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You look
      tired. Take a chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man in black bowed respectfully, and took his seat.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ROBERT MOODY was at this time nearly forty years of age. He was a shy,
      quiet, dark person, with a pale, closely-shaven face, agreeably animated
      by large black eyes, set deep in their orbits. His mouth was perhaps his
      best feature; he had firm, well-shaped lips, which softened on rare
      occasions into a particularly winning smile. The whole look of the man, in
      spite of his habitual reserve, declared him to be eminently trustworthy.
      His position in Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s household was in no sense of the menial
      sort. He acted as her almoner and secretary as well as her steward&mdash;distributed
      her charities, wrote her letters on business, paid her bills, engaged her
      servants, stocked her wine-cellar, was authorized to borrow books from her
      library, and was served with his meals in his own room. His parentage gave
      him claims to these special favors; he was by birth entitled to rank as a
      gentleman. His father had failed at a time of commercial panic as a
      country banker, had paid a good dividend, and had died in exile abroad a
      broken-hearted man. Robert had tried to hold his place in the world, but
      adverse fortune kept him down. Undeserved disaster followed him from one
      employment to another, until he abandoned the struggle, bade a last
      farewell to the pride of other days, and accepted the position
      considerately and delicately offered to him in Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house. He
      had now no near relations living, and he had never made many friends. In
      the intervals of occupation he led a lonely life in his little room. It
      was a matter of secret wonder among the women in the servants&rsquo; hall,
      considering his personal advantages and the opportunities which must
      surely have been thrown in his way, that he had never tempted fortune in
      the character of a married man. Robert Moody entered into no explanations
      on that subject. In his own sad and quiet way he continued to lead his own
      sad and quiet life. The women all failing, from the handsome housekeeper
      downward, to make the smallest impression on him, consoled themselves by
      prophetic visions of his future relations with the sex, and predicted
      vindictively that &ldquo;his time would come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lady Lydiard, &ldquo;and what have you done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Ladyship seemed to be anxious about the dog,&rdquo; Moody answered, in the
      low tone which was habitual to him. &ldquo;I went first to the veterinary
      surgeon. He had been called away into the country; and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard waved away the conclusion of the sentence with her hand.
      &ldquo;Never mind the surgeon. We must find somebody else. Where did you go
      next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your Ladyship&rsquo;s lawyer. Mr. Troy wished me to say that he will have
      the honor of waiting on you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass over the lawyer, Moody. I want to know about the painter&rsquo;s widow. Is
      it true that Mrs. Tollmidge and her family are left in helpless poverty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite true, my Lady. I have seen the clergyman of the parish, who
      takes an interest in the case&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard interrupted her steward for the third time. &ldquo;Did you mention
      my name?&rdquo; she asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, my Lady. I followed my instructions, and described you as
      a benevolent person in search of cases of real distress. It is quite true
      that Mr. Tollmidge has died, leaving nothing to his family. But the widow
      has a little income of seventy pounds in her own right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that enough to live on, Moody?&rdquo; her Ladyship asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, in this case, for the widow and her daughter,&rdquo; Moody answered.
      &ldquo;The difficulty is to pay the few debts left standing, and to start the
      two sons in life. They are reported to be steady lads; and the family is
      much respected in the neighborhood. The clergyman proposes to get a few
      influential names to begin with, and to start a subscription.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No subscription!&rdquo; protested Lady Lydiard. &ldquo;Mr. Tollmidge was Lord
      Lydiard&rsquo;s cousin; and Mrs. Tollmidge is related to his Lordship by
      marriage. It would be degrading to my husband&rsquo;s memory to have the
      begging-box sent round for his relations, no matter how distant they may
      be. Cousins!&rdquo; exclaimed her Ladyship, suddenly descending from the lofty
      ranges of sentiment to the low. &ldquo;I hate the very name of them! A person
      who is near enough to me to be my relation and far enough off from me to
      be my sweetheart, is a double-faced sort of person that I don&rsquo;t like.
      Let&rsquo;s get back to the widow and her sons. How much do they want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A subscription of five hundred pounds, my Lady, would provide for
      everything&mdash;if it could only be collected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>shall</i> be collected, Moody! I will pay the subscription out of
      my own purse.&rdquo; Having asserted herself in those noble terms, she spoilt
      the effect of her own outburst of generosity by dropping to the sordid
      view of the subject in her next sentence. &ldquo;Five hundred pounds is a good
      bit of money, though; isn&rsquo;t it, Moody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, indeed, my Lady.&rdquo; Rich and generous as he knew his mistress to be,
      her proposal to pay the whole subscription took the steward by surprise.
      Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s quick perception instantly detected what was passing in his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t quite understand my position in this matter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I
      read the newspaper notice of Mr. Tollmidge&rsquo;s death, I searched among his
      Lordship&rsquo;s papers to see if they really were related. I discovered some
      letters from Mr. Tollmidge, which showed me that he and Lord Lydiard were
      cousins. One of those letters contains some very painful statements,
      reflecting most untruly and unjustly on my conduct; lies, in short,&rdquo; her
      Ladyship burst out, losing her dignity, as usual. &ldquo;Lies, Moody, for which
      Mr. Tollmidge deserved to be horsewhipped. I would have done it myself if
      his Lordship had told me at the time. No matter; it&rsquo;s useless to dwell on
      the thing now,&rdquo; she continued, ascending again to the forms of expression
      which became a lady of rank. &ldquo;This unhappy man has done me a gross
      injustice; my motives may be seriously misjudged, if I appear personally
      in communicating with his family. If I relieve them anonymously in their
      present trouble, I spare them the exposure of a public subscription, and I
      do what I believe his Lordship would have done himself if he had lived. My
      desk is on the other table. Bring it here, Moody; and let me return good
      for evil, while I&rsquo;m in the humor for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody obeyed in silence. Lady Lydiard wrote a check.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that to the banker&rsquo;s, and bring back a five-hundred pound note,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll inclose it to the clergyman as coming from &lsquo;an unknown
      friend.&rsquo; And be quick about it. I am only a fallible mortal, Moody. Don&rsquo;t
      leave me time enough to take the stingy view of five hundred pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody went out with the check. No delay was to be apprehended in obtaining
      the money; the banking-house was hard by, in St. James&rsquo;s Street. Left
      alone, Lady Lydiard decided on occupying her mind in the generous
      direction by composing her anonymous letter to the clergyman. She had just
      taken a sheet of note-paper from her desk, when a servant appeared at the
      door announcing a visitor&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Felix Sweetsir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY nephew!&rdquo; Lady Lydiard exclaimed in a tone which expressed
      astonishment, but certainly not pleasure as well. &ldquo;How many years is it
      since you and I last met?&rdquo; she asked, in her abruptly straightforward way,
      as Mr. Felix Sweetsir approached her writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor was not a person easily discouraged. He took Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s
      hand, and kissed it with easy grace. A shade of irony was in his manner,
      agreeably relieved by a playful flash of tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Years, my dear aunt?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look in your glass and you will see that
      time has stood still since we met last. How wonderfully well you wear!
      When shall we celebrate the appearance of your first wrinkle? I am too
      old; I shall never live to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took an easychair, uninvited; placed himself close at his aunt&rsquo;s side,
      and ran his eye over her ill-chosen dress with an air of satirical
      admiration. &ldquo;How perfectly successful!&rdquo; he said, with his well-bred
      insolence. &ldquo;What a chaste gayety of color!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked her Ladyship, not in the least softened by the
      compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to pay my respects to my dear aunt,&rdquo; Felix answered, perfectly
      impenetrable to his ungracious reception, and perfectly comfortable in a
      spacious arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      No pen-and-ink portrait need surely be drawn of Felix Sweetsir&mdash;he is
      too well-known a picture in society. The little lithe man, with his
      bright, restless eyes, and his long iron-gray hair falling in curls to his
      shoulders, his airy step and his cordial manner; his uncertain age, his
      innumerable accomplishments, and his unbounded popularity&mdash;is he not
      familiar everywhere, and welcome everywhere? How gratefully he receives,
      how prodigally he repays, the cordial appreciation of an admiring world!
      Every man he knows is &ldquo;a charming fellow.&rdquo; Every woman he sees is &ldquo;sweetly
      pretty.&rdquo; What picnics he gives on the banks of the Thames in the summer
      season! What a well-earned little income he derives from the whist-table!
      What an inestimable actor he is at private theatricals of all sorts
      (weddings included)! Did you never read Sweetsir&rsquo;s novel, dashed off in
      the intervals of curative perspiration at a German bath? Then you don&rsquo;t
      know what brilliant fiction really is. He has never written a second work;
      he does everything, and only does it once. One song&mdash;the despair of
      professional composers. One picture&mdash;just to show how easily a
      gentleman can take up an art and drop it again. A really multiform man,
      with all the graces and all the accomplishments scintillating perpetually
      at his fingers&rsquo; ends. If these poor pages have achieved nothing else, they
      have done a service to persons not in society by presenting them to
      Sweetsir. In his gracious company the narrative brightens; and writer and
      reader (catching reflected brilliancy) understand each other at last,
      thanks to Sweetsir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lady Lydiard, &ldquo;now you are here, what have you got to say for
      yourself? You have been abroad, of course! Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Principally at Paris, my dear aunt. The only place that is fit to live in&mdash;for
      this excellent reason, that the French are the only people who know how to
      make the most of life. One has relations and friends in England and every
      now and then one returns to London&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When one has spent all one&rsquo;s money in Paris,&rdquo; her Ladyship interposed.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you were going to say, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix submitted to the interruption with his delightful good-humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a bright creature you are!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What would I not give for
      your flow of spirits! Yes&mdash;one does spend money in Paris, as you say.
      The clubs, the stock exchange, the race-course: you try your luck here,
      there, and everywhere; and you lose and win, win and lose&mdash;and you
      haven&rsquo;t a dull day to complain of.&rdquo; He paused, his smile died away, he
      looked inquiringly at Lady Lydiard. &ldquo;What a wonderful existence yours must
      be,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;The everlasting question with your needy
      fellow-creatures, &lsquo;Where am I to get money?&rsquo; is a question that has never
      passed your lips. Enviable woman!&rdquo; He paused once more&mdash;surprised and
      puzzled this time. &ldquo;What is the matter, my dear aunt? You seem to be
      suffering under some uneasiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am suffering under your conversation,&rdquo; her Ladyship answered sharply.
      &ldquo;Money is a sore subject with me just now,&rdquo; she went on, with her eyes on
      her nephew, watching the effect of what she said. &ldquo;I have spent five
      hundred pounds this morning with a scrape of my pen. And, only a week
      since, I yielded to temptation and made an addition to my
      picture-gallery.&rdquo; She looked, as she said those words, towards an archway
      at the further end of the room, closed by curtains of purple velvet. &ldquo;I
      really tremble when I think of what that one picture cost me before I
      could call it mine. A landscape by Hobbema; and the National Gallery
      bidding against me. Never mind!&rdquo; she concluded, consoling herself, as
      usual, with considerations that were beneath her. &ldquo;Hobbema will sell at my
      death for a bigger price than I gave for him&mdash;that&rsquo;s one comfort!&rdquo;
       She looked again at Felix; a smile of mischievous satisfaction began to
      show itself in her face. &ldquo;Anything wrong with your watch-chain?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix, absently playing with his watch-chain, started as if his aunt had
      suddenly awakened him. While Lady Lydiard had been speaking, his vivacity
      had subsided little by little, and had left him looking so serious and so
      old that his most intimate friend would hardly have known him again.
      Roused by the sudden question that had been put to him, he seemed to be
      casting about in his mind in search of the first excuse for his silence
      that might turn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;why I miss something when I look round this
      beautiful room; something familiar, you know, that I fully expected to
      find here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tommie?&rdquo; suggested Lady Lydiard, still watching her nephew as maliciously
      as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Felix, seizing his excuse, and rallying his spirits.
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I hear Tommie snarling behind me; why don&rsquo;t I feel Tommie&rsquo;s
      teeth in my trousers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile vanished from Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s face; the tone taken by her nephew
      in speaking of her dog was disrespectful in the extreme. She showed him
      plainly that she disapproved of it. Felix went on, nevertheless,
      impenetrable to reproof of the silent sort. &ldquo;Dear little Tommie! So
      delightfully fat; and such an infernal temper! I don&rsquo;t know whether I hate
      him or love him. Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill in bed,&rdquo; answered her ladyship, with a gravity which startled even
      Felix himself. &ldquo;I wish to speak to you about Tommie. You know everybody.
      Do you know of a good dog-doctor? The person I have employed so far
      doesn&rsquo;t at all satisfy me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professional person?&rdquo; inquired Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All humbugs, my dear aunt. The worse the dog gets the bigger the bill
      grows, don&rsquo;t you see? I have got the man for you&mdash;a gentleman. Knows
      more about horses and dogs than all the veterinary surgeons put together.
      We met in the boat yesterday crossing the Channel. You know him by name,
      of course? Lord Rotherfield&rsquo;s youngest son, Alfred Hardyman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The owner of the stud farm? The man who has bred the famous racehorses?&rdquo;
       cried Lady Lydiard. &ldquo;My dear Felix, how can I presume to trouble such a
      great personage about my dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix burst into his genial laugh. &ldquo;Never was modesty more woefully out of
      place,&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;Hardyman is dying to be presented to your Ladyship.
      He has heard, like everybody, of the magnificent decorations of this
      house, and he is longing to see them. His chambers are close by, in Pall
      Mall. If he is at home we will have him here in five minutes. Perhaps I
      had better see the dog first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard shook her head. &ldquo;Isabel says he had better not be disturbed,&rdquo;
       she answered. &ldquo;Isabel understands him better than anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix lifted his lively eyebrows with a mixed expression of curiosity and
      surprise. &ldquo;Who is Isabel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard was vexed with herself for carelessly mentioning Isabel&rsquo;s
      name in her nephew&rsquo;s presence. Felix was not the sort of person whom she
      was desirous of admitting to her confidence in domestic matters. &ldquo;Isabel
      is an addition to my household since you were here last,&rdquo; she answered
      shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young and pretty?&rdquo; inquired Felix. &ldquo;Ah! you look serious, and you don&rsquo;t
      answer me. Young and pretty, evidently. Which may I see first, the
      addition to your household or the addition to your picture-gallery? You
      look at the picture-gallery&mdash;I am answered again.&rdquo; He rose to
      approach the archway, and stopped at his first step forward. &ldquo;A sweet girl
      is a dreadful responsibility, aunt,&rdquo; he resumed, with an ironical
      assumption of gravity. &ldquo;Do you know, I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Isabel,
      in the long run, cost you more than Hobbema. Who is this at the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person at the door was Robert Moody, returned from the bank. Mr. Felix
      Sweetsir, being near-sighted, was obliged to fit his eye-glass in position
      before he could recognize the prime minister of Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! our worthy Moody. How well he wears! Not a gray hair on his head&mdash;and
      look at mine! What dye do you use, Moody? If he had my open disposition he
      would tell. As it is, he looks unutterable things, and holds his tongue.
      Ah! if I could only have held <i>my</i> tongue&mdash;when I was in the
      diplomatic service, you know&mdash;what a position I might have occupied
      by this time! Don&rsquo;t let me interrupt you, Moody, if you have anything to
      say to Lady Lydiard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having acknowledged Mr. Sweetsir&rsquo;s lively greeting by a formal bow, and a
      grave look of wonder which respectfully repelled that vivacious
      gentleman&rsquo;s flow of humor, Moody turned towards his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the bank-note?&rdquo; asked her Ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moody laid the bank-note on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I in the way?&rdquo; inquired Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his aunt. &ldquo;I have a letter to write; it won&rsquo;t occupy me for
      more than a few minutes. You can stay here, or go and look at the Hobbema,
      which you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix made a second sauntering attempt to reach the picture-gallery.
      Arrived within a few steps of the entrance, he stopped again, attracted by
      an open cabinet of Italian workmanship, filled with rare old china. Being
      nothing if not a cultivated amateur, Mr. Sweetsir paused to pay his
      passing tribute of admiration before the contents of the cabinet.
      &ldquo;Charming! charming!&rdquo; he said to himself, with his head twisted
      appreciatively a little on one side. Lady Lydiard and Moody left him in
      undisturbed enjoyment of the china, and went on with the business of the
      bank-note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought we to take the number of the note, in case of accident?&rdquo; asked her
      Ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moody produced a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket. &ldquo;I took the
      number, my Lady, at the bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. You keep it. While I am writing my letter, suppose you direct
      the envelope. What is the clergyman&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody mentioned the name and directed the envelope. Felix, happening to
      look round at Lady Lydiard and the steward while they were both engaged in
      writing, returned suddenly to the table as if he had been struck by a new
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a third pen?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I write a line at once to
      Hardyman, aunt? The sooner you have his opinion about Tommie the better&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard pointed to the pen tray, with a smile. To show consideration
      for her dog was to seize irresistibly on the high-road to her favor. Felix
      set to work on his letter, in a large scrambling handwriting, with plenty
      of ink and a noisy pen. &ldquo;I declare we are like clerks in an office,&rdquo; he
      remarked, in his cheery way. &ldquo;All with our noses to the paper, writing as
      if we lived by it! Here, Moody, let one of the servants take this at once
      to Mr. Hardyman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The messenger was despatched. Robert returned, and waited near his
      mistress, with the directed envelope in his hand. Felix sauntered back
      slowly towards the picture-gallery, for the third time. In a moment more
      Lady Lydiard finished her letter, and folded up the bank-note in it. She
      had just taken the directed envelope from Moody, and had just placed the
      letter inside it, when a scream from the inner room, in which Isabel was
      nursing the sick dog, startled everybody. &ldquo;My Lady! my Lady!&rdquo; cried the
      girl, distractedly, &ldquo;Tommie is in a fit? Tommie is dying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard dropped the unclosed envelope on the table, and ran&mdash;yes,
      short as she was and fat as she was, ran&mdash;into the inner room. The
      two men, left together, looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moody,&rdquo; said Felix, in his lazily-cynical way, &ldquo;do you think if you or I
      were in a fit that her Ladyship would run? Bah! these are the things that
      shake one&rsquo;s faith in human nature. I feel infernally seedy. That cursed
      Channel passage&mdash;I tremble in my inmost stomach when I think of it.
      Get me something, Moody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I send you, sir?&rdquo; Moody asked coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some dry curacoa and a biscuit. And let it be brought to me in the
      picture-gallery. Damn the dog! I&rsquo;ll go and look at Hobbema.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time he succeeded in reaching the archway, and disappeared behind the
      curtains of the picture-gallery.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      LEFT alone in the drawing-room, Moody looked at the unfastened envelope on
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the value of the inclosure, might he feel justified in wetting
      the gum and securing the envelope for safety&rsquo;s sake? After thinking it
      over, Moody decided that he was not justified in meddling with the letter.
      On reflection, her Ladyship might have changes to make in it or might have
      a postscript to add to what she had already written. Apart too, from these
      considerations, was it reasonable to act as if Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house was a
      hotel, perpetually open to the intrusion of strangers? Objects worth twice
      five hundred pounds in the aggregate were scattered about on the tables
      and in the unlocked cabinets all round him. Moody withdrew, without
      further hesitation, to order the light restorative prescribed for himself
      by Mr. Sweetsir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman who took the curacoa into the picture gallery found Felix
      recumbent on a sofa, admiring the famous Hobbema.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me,&rdquo; he said peevishly, catching the servant in the act
      of staring at him. &ldquo;Put down the bottle and go!&rdquo; Forbidden to look at Mr.
      Sweetsir, the man&rsquo;s eyes as he left the gallery turned wonderingly towards
      the famous landscape. And what did he see? He saw one towering big cloud
      in the sky that threatened rain, two withered mahogany-colored trees
      sorely in want of rain, a muddy road greatly the worse for rain, and a
      vagabond boy running home who was afraid of the rain. That was the
      picture, to the footman&rsquo;s eye. He took a gloomy view of the state of Mr.
      Sweetsir&rsquo;s brains on his return to the servants&rsquo; hall. &ldquo;A slate loose,
      poor devil!&rdquo; That was the footman&rsquo;s report of the brilliant Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately on the servant&rsquo;s departure, the silence in the picture-gallery
      was broken by voices penetrating into it from the drawing-room. Felix rose
      to a sitting position on the sofa. He had recognized the voice of Alfred
      Hardyman saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb Lady Lydiard,&rdquo; and the voice of Moody
      answering, &ldquo;I will just knock at the door of her Ladyship&rsquo;s room, sir; you
      will find Mr. Sweetsir in the picture-gallery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The curtains over the archway parted, and disclosed the figure of a tall
      man, with a closely cropped head set a little stiffly on his shoulders.
      The immovable gravity of face and manner which every Englishman seems to
      acquire who lives constantly in the society of horses, was the gravity
      which this gentleman displayed as he entered the picture-gallery. He was a
      finely made, sinewy man, with clearly cut, regular features. If he had not
      been affected with horses on the brain he would doubtless have been
      personally popular with the women. As it was, the serene and hippic gloom
      of the handsome horse-breeder daunted the daughters of Eve, and they
      failed to make up their minds about the exact value of him, socially
      considered. Alfred Hardyman was nevertheless a remarkable man in his way.
      He had been offered the customary alternatives submitted to the younger
      sons of the nobility&mdash;the Church or the diplomatic service&mdash;and
      had refused the one and the other. &ldquo;I like horses,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I mean
      to get my living out of them. Don&rsquo;t talk to me about my position in the
      world. Talk to my eldest brother, who gets the money and the title.&rdquo;
       Starting in life with these sensible views, and with a small capital of
      five thousand pounds, Hardyman took his own place in the sphere that was
      fitted for him. At the period of this narrative he was already a rich man,
      and one of the greatest authorities on horse-breeding in England. His
      prosperity made no change in him. He was always the same grave, quiet,
      obstinately resolute man&mdash;true to the few friends whom he admitted to
      his intimacy, and sincere to a fault in the expression of his feelings
      among persons whom he distrusted or disliked. As he entered the
      picture-gallery and paused for a moment looking at Felix on the sofa, his
      large, cold, steady gray eyes rested on the little man with an
      indifference that just verged on contempt. Felix, on the other hand,
      sprang to his feet with alert politeness and greeted his friend with
      exuberant cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old boy! This is so good of you,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I feel it&mdash;I do
      assure you I feel it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t trouble yourself to feel it,&rdquo; was the quietly-ungracious
      answer. &ldquo;Lady Lydiard brings me here. I come to see the house&mdash;and
      the dog.&rdquo; He looked round the gallery in his gravely attentive way. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t understand pictures,&rdquo; he remarked resignedly. &ldquo;I shall go back to
      the drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s consideration, Felix followed him into the drawing-room,
      with the air of a man who was determined not to be repelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Hardyman. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that matter?&rdquo; Felix said, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know. Will next week do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next week <i>won&rsquo;t</i> do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Felix Sweetsir cast one look at his friend. His friend was too
      intently occupied with the decorations of the drawing-room to notice the
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will to-morrow do?&rdquo; Felix resumed, after an interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between twelve and one in the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between twelve and one in the afternoon,&rdquo; Felix repeated. He looked again
      at Hardyman and took his hat. &ldquo;Make my apologies to my aunt,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;You must introduce yourself to her Ladyship. I can&rsquo;t wait here any
      longer.&rdquo; He walked out of the room, having deliberately returned the
      contemptuous indifference of Hardyman by a similar indifference on his own
      side, at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left by himself, Hardyman took a chair and glanced at the door which led
      into the boudoir. The steward had knocked at that door, had disappeared
      through it, and had not appeared again. How much longer was Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s
      visitor to be left unnoticed in Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house?
    </p>
    <p>
      As the question passed through his mind the boudoir door opened. For once
      in his life, Alfred Hardyman&rsquo;s composure deserted him. He started to his
      feet, like an ordinary mortal taken completely by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of Mr. Moody, instead of Lady Lydiard, there appeared in the open
      doorway a young woman in a state of embarrassment, who actually quickened
      the beat of Mr. Hardyman&rsquo;s heart the moment he set eyes on her. Was the
      person who produced this amazing impression at first sight a person of
      importance? Nothing of the sort. She was only &ldquo;Isabel&rdquo; surnamed &ldquo;Miller.&rdquo;
       Even her name had nothing in it. Only &ldquo;Isabel Miller!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had she any pretensions to distinction in virtue of her personal
      appearance?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not easy to answer the question. The women (let us put the worst
      judges first) had long since discovered that she wanted that indispensable
      elegance of figure which is derived from slimness of waist and length of
      limb. The men (who were better acquainted with the subject) looked at her
      figure from their point of view; and, finding it essentially embraceable,
      asked for nothing more. It might have been her bright complexion or it
      might have been the bold luster of her eyes (as the women considered it),
      that dazzled the lords of creation generally, and made them all alike
      incompetent to discover her faults. Still, she had compensating
      attractions which no severity of criticism could dispute. Her smile,
      beginning at her lips, flowed brightly and instantly over her whole face.
      A delicious atmosphere of health, freshness, and good humor seemed to
      radiate from her wherever she went and whatever she did. For the rest her
      brown hair grew low over her broad white forehead, and was topped by a
      neat little lace cap with ribbons of a violet color. A plain collar and
      plain cuffs encircled her smooth, round neck, and her plump dimpled hands.
      Her merino dress, covering but not hiding the charming outline of her
      bosom, matched the color of the cap-ribbons, and was brightened by a white
      muslin apron coquettishly trimmed about the pockets, a gift from Lady
      Lydiard. Blushing and smiling, she let the door fall to behind her, and,
      shyly approaching the stranger, said to him, in her small, clear voice,
      &ldquo;If you please, sir, are you Mr. Hardyman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gravity of the great horse-breeder deserted him at her first question.
      He smiled as he acknowledged that he was &ldquo;Mr. Hardyman&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled as
      he offered her a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, sir,&rdquo; she said, with a quaintly pretty inclination of her
      head. &ldquo;I am only sent here to make her Ladyship&rsquo;s apologies. She has put
      the poor dear dog into a warm bath, and she can&rsquo;t leave him. And Mr. Moody
      can&rsquo;t come instead of me, because I was too frightened to be of any use,
      and so he had to hold the dog. That&rsquo;s all. We are very anxious sir, to
      know if the warm bath is the right thing. Please come into the room and
      tell us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led the way back to the door. Hardyman, naturally enough, was slow to
      follow her. When a man is fascinated by the charm of youth and beauty, he
      is in no hurry to transfer his attention to a sick animal in a bath.
      Hardyman seized on the first excuse that he could devise for keeping
      Isabel to himself&mdash;that is to say, for keeping her in the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall be better able to help you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you will tell
      me something about the dog first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even his accent in speaking had altered to a certain degree. The quiet,
      dreary monotone in which he habitually spoke quickened a little under his
      present excitement. As for Isabel, she was too deeply interested in
      Tommie&rsquo;s welfare to suspect that she was being made the victim of a
      stratagem. She left the door and returned to Hardyman with eager eyes.
      &ldquo;What can I tell you, sir?&rdquo; she asked innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman pressed his advantage without mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell me what sort of dog he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What his name is?&mdash;what his temper is?&mdash;what his illness is?
      what diseases his father and mother had?&mdash;what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel&rsquo;s head began to turn giddy. &ldquo;One thing at a time, sir!&rdquo; she
      interposed, with a gesture of entreaty. &ldquo;The dog sleeps on my bed, and I
      had a bad night with him, he disturbed me so, and I am afraid I am very
      stupid this morning. His name is Tommie. We are obliged to call him by it,
      because he won&rsquo;t answer to any other than the name he had when my Lady
      bought him. But we spell it with an <i>i e</i> at the end, which makes it
      less vulgar than Tommy with a <i>y</i>. I am very sorry, sir&mdash;I
      forget what else you wanted to know. Please to come in here and my Lady
      will tell you everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried to get back to the door of the boudoir. Hardyman, feasting his
      eyes on the pretty, changeful face that looked up at him with such
      innocent confidence in his authority, drew her away from the door by the
      one means at his disposal. He returned to his questions about Tommie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a little, please. What sort of dog is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel turned back again from the door. To describe Tommie was a labor of
      love. &ldquo;He is the most beautiful dog in the world!&rdquo; the girl began, with
      kindling eyes. &ldquo;He has the most exquisite white curly hair and two light
      brown patches on his back&mdash;and, oh! <i>such</i> lovely dark eyes!
      They call him a Scotch terrier. When he is well his appetite is truly
      wonderful&mdash;nothing comes amiss to him, sir, from pate de foie gras to
      potatoes. He has his enemies, poor dear, though you wouldn&rsquo;t think it.
      People who won&rsquo;t put up with being bitten by him (what shocking tempers
      one does meet with, to be sure!) call him a mongrel. Isn&rsquo;t it a shame?
      Please come in and see him, sir; my Lady will be tired of waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another journey to the door followed those words, checked instantly by a
      serious objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute! You must tell me what his temper is, or I can do nothing
      for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel returned once more, feeling that it was really serious this time.
      Her gravity was even more charming than her gayety. As she lifted her face
      to him, with large solemn eyes, expressive of her sense of responsibility,
      Hardyman would have given every horse in his stables to have had the
      privilege of taking her in his arms and kissing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tommie has the temper of an angel with the people he likes,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;When he bites, it generally means that he objects to strangers. He loves
      my Lady, and he loves Mr. Moody, and he loves me, and&mdash;and I think
      that&rsquo;s all. This way, sir, if you please, I am sure I heard my Lady call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hardyman, in his immovably obstinate way. &ldquo;Nobody called. About
      this dog&rsquo;s temper? Doesn&rsquo;t he take to any strangers? What sort of people
      does he bite in general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel&rsquo;s pretty lips began to curl upward at the corners in a quaint
      smile. Hardyman&rsquo;s last imbecile question had opened her eyes to the true
      state of the case. Still, Tommie&rsquo;s future was in this strange gentleman&rsquo;s
      hands; she felt bound to consider that. And, moreover, it was no everyday
      event, in Isabel&rsquo;s experience, to fascinate a famous personage, who was
      also a magnificent and perfectly dressed man. She ran the risk of wasting
      another minute or two, and went on with the memoirs of Tommie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must own, sir,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;that he behaves a little ungratefully&mdash;even
      to strangers who take an interest in him. When he gets lost in the streets
      (which is very often), he sits down on the pavement and howls till he
      collects a pitying crowd round him; and when they try to read his name and
      address on his collar he snaps at them. The servants generally find him
      and bring him back; and as soon as he gets home he turns round on the
      doorstep and snaps at the servants. I think it must be his fun. You should
      see him sitting up in his chair at dinner-time, waiting to be helped, with
      his fore paws on the edge of the table, like the hands of a gentleman at a
      public dinner making a speech. But, oh!&rdquo; cried Isabel, checking herself,
      with the tears in her eyes, &ldquo;how can I talk of him in this way when he is
      so dreadfully ill! Some of them say it&rsquo;s bronchitis, and some say it&rsquo;s his
      liver. Only yesterday I took him to the front door to give him a little
      air, and he stood still on the pavement, quite stupefied. For the first
      time in his life, he snapped at nobody who went by; and, oh, dear, he
      hadn&rsquo;t even the heart to smell a lamp-post!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel had barely stated this last afflicting circumstance when the
      memoirs of Tommie were suddenly cut short by the voice of Lady Lydiard&mdash;really
      calling this time&mdash;from the inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isabel! Isabel!&rdquo; cried her Ladyship, &ldquo;what are you about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel ran to the door of the boudoir and threw it open. &ldquo;Go in, sir! Pray
      go in!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without you?&rdquo; Hardyman asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will follow you, sir. I have something to do for her Ladyship first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still held the door open, and pointed entreatingly to the passage
      which led to the boudoir &ldquo;I shall be blamed, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t
      go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This statement of the case left Hardyman no alternative. He presented
      himself to Lady Lydiard without another moment of delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having closed the drawing-room door on him, Isabel waited a little,
      absorbed in her own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now perfectly well aware of the effect which she had produced on
      Hardyman. Her vanity, it is not to be denied, was flattered by his
      admiration&mdash;he was so grand and so tall, and he had such fine large
      eyes. The girl looked prettier than ever as she stood with her head down
      and her color heightened, smiling to herself. A clock on the chimney-piece
      striking the half-hour roused her. She cast one look at the glass, as she
      passed it, and went to the table at which Lady Lydiard had been writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Methodical Mr. Moody, in submitting to be employed as bath-attendant upon
      Tommie, had not forgotten the interests of his mistress. He reminded her
      Ladyship that she had left her letter, with a bank-note inclosed in it,
      unsealed. Absorbed in the dog, Lady Lydiard answered, &ldquo;Isabel is doing
      nothing, let Isabel seal it. Show Mr. Hardyman in here,&rdquo; she continued,
      turning to Isabel, &ldquo;and then seal a letter of mine which you will find on
      the table.&rdquo; &ldquo;And when you have sealed it,&rdquo; careful Mr. Moody added, &ldquo;put
      it back on the table; I will take charge of it when her Ladyship has done
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the special instructions which now detained Isabel in the
      drawing-room. She lighted the taper, and closed and sealed the open
      envelope, without feeling curiosity enough even to look at the address.
      Mr. Hardyman was the uppermost subject in her thoughts. Leaving the sealed
      letter on the table, she returned to the fireplace, and studied her own
      charming face attentively in the looking-glass. The time passed&mdash;and
      Isabel&rsquo;s reflection was still the subject of Isabel&rsquo;s contemplation. &ldquo;He
      must see many beautiful ladies,&rdquo; she thought, veering backward and forward
      between pride and humility. &ldquo;I wonder what he sees in Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck the hour. Almost at the same moment the boudoir-door
      opened, and Robert Moody, released at last from attendance on Tommie,
      entered the drawing-room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WELL?&rdquo; asked Isabel eagerly, &ldquo;what does Mr. Hardyman say? Does he think
      he can cure Tommie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody answered a little coldly and stiffly. His dark, deeply-set eyes
      rested on Isabel with an uneasy look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hardyman seems to understand animals,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He lifted the dog&rsquo;s
      eyelid and looked at his eyes, and then he told us the bath was useless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; said Isabel impatiently. &ldquo;He did something, I suppose, besides
      telling you that the bath was useless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took a knife out of his pocket, with a lancet in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel clasped her hands with a faint cry of horror. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Moody! did
      he hurt Tommie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurt him?&rdquo; Moody repeated, indignant at the interest which she felt in
      the animal, and the indifference which she exhibited towards the man (as
      represented by himself). &ldquo;Hurt him, indeed! Mr. Hardyman bled the brute&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brute?&rdquo; Isabel reiterated, with flashing eyes. &ldquo;I know some people, Mr.
      Moody, who really deserve to be called by that horrid word. If you can&rsquo;t
      say &lsquo;Tommie,&rsquo; when you speak of him in my presence, be so good as to say
      &lsquo;the dog.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody yielded with the worst possible grace. &ldquo;Oh, very well! Mr. Hardyman
      bled the dog, and brought him to his senses directly. I am charged to tell
      you&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, as if the message which he was instructed to
      deliver was in the last degree distasteful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what were you charged to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was to say that Mr. Hardyman will give you instructions how to treat
      the dog for the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel hastened to the door, eager to receive her instructions. Moody
      stopped her before she could open it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in a great hurry to get to Mr. Hardyman,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel looked back at him in surprise. &ldquo;You said just now that Mr.
      Hardyman was waiting to tell me how to nurse Tommie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him wait,&rdquo; Moody rejoined sternly. &ldquo;When I left him, he was
      sufficiently occupied in expressing his favorable opinion of you to her
      Ladyship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steward&rsquo;s pale face turned paler still as he said those words. With
      the arrival of Isabel in Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house &ldquo;his time had come&rdquo;&mdash;exactly
      as the women in the servants&rsquo; hall had predicted. At last the impenetrable
      man felt the influence of the sex; at last he knew the passion of love
      misplaced, ill-starred, hopeless love, for a woman who was young enough to
      be his child. He had already spoken to Isabel more than once in terms
      which told his secret plainly enough. But the smouldering fire of jealousy
      in the man, fanned into flame by Hardyman, now showed itself for the first
      time. His looks, even more than his words, would have warned a woman with
      any knowledge of the natures of men to be careful how she answered him.
      Young, giddy, and inexperienced, Isabel followed the flippant impulse of
      the moment, without a thought of the consequences. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very
      kind of Mr. Hardyman to speak favorably of me,&rdquo; she said, with a pert
      little laugh. &ldquo;I hope you are not jealous of him, Mr. Moody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody was in no humor to make allowances for the unbridled gayety of youth
      and good spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate any man who admires you,&rdquo; he burst out passionately, &ldquo;let him be
      who he may!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel looked at her strange lover with unaffected astonishment. How
      unlike Mr. Hardyman, who had treated her as a lady from first to last!
      &ldquo;What an odd man you are!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take a joke. I&rsquo;m sure I
      didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t offend me&mdash;you do worse, you distress me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel&rsquo;s color began to rise. The merriment died out of her face; she
      looked at Moody gravely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be accused of distressing people
      when I don&rsquo;t deserve it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had better leave you. Let me by, if
      you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having committed one error in offending her, Moody committed another in
      attempting to make his peace with her. Acting under the fear that she
      would really leave him, he took her roughly by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always trying to get away from me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish I knew how
      to make you like me, Isabel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t allow you to call me Isabel!&rdquo; she retorted, struggling to free
      herself from his hold. &ldquo;Let go of my arm. You hurt me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody dropped her arm with a bitter sigh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to deal with
      you,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;Have some pity on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the steward had known anything of women (at Isabel&rsquo;s age) he would
      never have appealed to her mercy in those plain terms, and at the
      unpropitious moment. &ldquo;Pity you?&rdquo; she repeated contemptuously. &ldquo;Is that all
      you have to say to me after hurting my arm? What a bear you are!&rdquo; She
      shrugged her shoulders and put her hands coquettishly into the pockets of
      her apron. That was how she pitied him! His face turned paler and paler&mdash;he
      writhed under it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t turn everything I say to you into ridicule!&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;You know I love you with all my heart and soul. Again and again I
      have asked you to be my wife&mdash;and you laugh at me as if it was a
      joke. I haven&rsquo;t deserved to be treated in that cruel way. It maddens me&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t endure it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel looked down on the floor, and followed the lines in the pattern of
      the carpet with the end of her smart little shoe. She could hardly have
      been further away from really understanding Moody if he had spoken in
      Hebrew. She was partly startled, partly puzzled, by the strong emotions
      which she had unconsciously called into being. &ldquo;Oh dear me!&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t you talk of something else? Why can&rsquo;t we be friends? Excuse me
      for mentioning it,&rdquo; she went on, looking up at him with a saucy smile,
      &ldquo;you are old enough to be my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody&rsquo;s head sank on his breast. &ldquo;I own it,&rdquo; he answered humbly. &ldquo;But
      there is something to be said for me. Men as old as I am have made good
      husbands before now. I would devote my whole life to make you happy. There
      isn&rsquo;t a wish you could form which I wouldn&rsquo;t be proud to obey. You must
      not reckon me by years. My youth has not been wasted in a profligate life;
      I can be truer to you and fonder of you than many a younger man. Surely my
      heart is not quite unworthy of you, when it is all yours. I have lived
      such a lonely, miserable life&mdash;and you might so easily brighten it.
      You are kind to everybody else, Isabel. Tell me, dear, why are you so hard
      on <i>me?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice trembled as he appealed to her in those simple words. He had
      taken the right way at last to produce an impression on her. She really
      felt for him. All that was true and tender in her nature began to rise in
      her and take his part. Unhappily, he felt too deeply and too strongly to
      be patient, and give her time. He completely misinterpreted her silence&mdash;completely
      mistook the motive that made her turn aside for a moment, to gather
      composure enough to speak to him. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he burst out bitterly, turning
      away on his side, &ldquo;you have no heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She instantly resented those unjust words. At that moment they wounded her
      to the quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know best,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have no doubt you are right. Remember one
      thing, however, that though I have no heart, I have never encouraged you,
      Mr. Moody. I have declared over and over again that I could only be your
      friend. Understand that for the future, if you please. There are plenty of
      nice women who will be glad to marry you, I have no doubt. You will always
      have my best wishes for your welfare. Good-morning. Her Ladyship will
      wonder what has become of me. Be so kind as to let me pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tortured by the passion that consumed him, Moody obstinately kept his
      place between Isabel and the door. The unworthy suspicion of her, which
      had been in his mind all through the interview, now forced its way
      outwards to expression at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No woman ever used a man as you use me without some reason for it,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;You have kept your secret wonderfully well&mdash;but sooner or
      later all secrets get found out. I know what is in your mind as well as
      you know it yourself. You are in love with some other man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel&rsquo;s face flushed deeply; the defensive pride of her sex was up in
      arms in an instant. She cast one disdainful look at Moody, without
      troubling herself to express her contempt in words. &ldquo;Stand out of my way,
      sir!&rdquo;&mdash;that was all she said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in love with some other man,&rdquo; he reiterated passionately. &ldquo;Deny
      it if you can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deny it?&rdquo; she repeated, with flashing eyes. &ldquo;What right have you to ask
      the question? Am I not free to do as I please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking at her, meditating his next words with a sudden and
      sinister change to self-restraint. Suppressed rage was in his rigidly set
      eyes, suppressed rage was in his trembling hand as he raised it
      emphatically while he spoke his next words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have one thing more to say,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and then I have done. If I
      am not your husband, no other man shall be. Look well to it, Isabel
      Miller. If there <i>is</i> another man between us, I can tell him this&mdash;he
      shall find it no easy matter to rob me of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started, and turned pale&mdash;but it was only for a moment. The high
      spirit that was in her rose brightly in her eyes, and faced him without
      shrinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Threats?&rdquo; she said, with quiet contempt. &ldquo;When you make love, Mr. Moody,
      you take strange ways of doing it. My conscience is easy. You may try to
      frighten me, but you will not succeed. When you have recovered your temper
      I will accept your excuses.&rdquo; She paused, and pointed to the table. &ldquo;There
      is the letter that you told me to leave for you when I had sealed it,&rdquo; she
      went on. &ldquo;I suppose you have her Ladyship&rsquo;s orders. Isn&rsquo;t it time you
      began to think of obeying them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The contemptuous composure of her tone and manner seemed to act on Moody
      with crushing effect. Without a word of answer, the unfortunate steward
      took up the letter from the table. Without a word of answer, he walked
      mechanically to the great door which opened on the staircase&mdash;turned
      on the threshold to look at Isabel&mdash;waited a moment, pale and still&mdash;and
      suddenly left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      That silent departure, that hopeless submission, impressed Isabel in spite
      of herself. The sustaining sense of injury and insult sank, as it were,
      from under her the moment she was alone. He had not been gone a minute
      before she began to be sorry for him once more. The interview had taught
      her nothing. She was neither old enough nor experienced enough to
      understand the overwhelming revolution produced in a man&rsquo;s character when
      he feels the passion of love for the first time in the maturity of his
      life. If Moody had stolen a kiss at the first opportunity, she would have
      resented the liberty he had taken with her; but she would have thoroughly
      understood him. His terrible earnestness, his overpowering agitation, his
      abrupt violence&mdash;all these evidences of a passion that was a mystery
      to himself&mdash;simply puzzled her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I didn&rsquo;t wish to hurt his
      feelings&rdquo; (such was the form that her reflections took, in her present
      penitent frame of mind); &ldquo;but why did he provoke me? It is a shame to tell
      me that I love some other man&mdash;when there is no other man. I declare
      I begin to hate the men, if they are all like Mr. Moody. I wonder whether
      he will forgive me when he sees me again? I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m willing to forget
      and forgive on my side&mdash;especially if he won&rsquo;t insist on my being
      fond of him because he is fond of me. Oh, dear! I wish he would come back
      and shake hands. It&rsquo;s enough to try the patience of a saint to be treated
      in this way. I wish I was ugly! The ugly ones have a quiet time of it&mdash;the
      men let them be. Mr. Moody! Mr. Moody!&rdquo; She went out to the landing and
      called to him softly. There was no answer. He was no longer in the house.
      She stood still for a moment in silent vexation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Tommie!&rdquo; she
      decided. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s the more agreeable company of the two. And&mdash;oh,
      good gracious! there&rsquo;s Mr. Hardyman waiting to give me my instructions!
      How do I look, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She consulted the glass once more&mdash;gave one or two corrective touches
      to her hair and her cap&mdash;and hastened into the boudoir.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      FOR a quarter of an hour the drawing-room remained empty. At the end of
      that time the council in the boudoir broke up. Lady Lydiard led the way
      back into the drawing-room, followed by Hardyman, Isabel being left to
      look after the dog. Before the door closed behind him, Hardyman turned
      round to reiterate his last medical directions&mdash;or, in plainer words,
      to take a last look at Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of water, Miss Isabel, for the dog to lap, and a little bread or
      biscuit, if he wants something to eat. Nothing more, if you please, till I
      see him to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir. I will take the greatest care&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that point Lady Lydiard cut short the interchange of instructions and
      civilities. &ldquo;Shut the door, if you please, Mr. Hardyman. I feel the
      draught. Many thanks! I am really at a loss to tell you how gratefully I
      feel your kindness. But for you my poor little dog might be dead by this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman answered, in the quiet melancholy monotone which was habitual
      with him, &ldquo;Your Ladyship need feel no further anxiety about the dog. Only
      be careful not to overfeed him. He will do very well under Miss Isabel&rsquo;s
      care. By the bye, her family name is Miller&mdash;is it not? Is she
      related to the Warwickshire Millers of Duxborough House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard looked at him with an expression of satirical surprise. &ldquo;Mr.
      Hardyman,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this makes the fourth time you have questioned me
      about Isabel. You seem to take a great interest in my little companion.
      Don&rsquo;t make any apologies, pray! You pay Isabel a compliment, and, as I am
      very fond of her, I am naturally gratified when I find her admired. At the
      same time,&rdquo; she added, with one of her abrupt transitions of language, &ldquo;I
      had my eye on you, and I had my eye on her, when you were talking in the
      next room; and I don&rsquo;t mean to let you make a fool of the girl. She is not
      in your line of life, and the sooner you know it the better. You make me
      laugh when you ask if she is related to gentlefolks. She is the orphan
      daughter of a chemist in the country. Her relations haven&rsquo;t a penny to
      bless themselves with, except an old aunt, who lives in a village on two
      or three hundred a year. I heard of the girl by accident. When she lost
      her father and mother, her aunt offered to take her. Isabel said, &lsquo;No,
      thank you; I will not be a burden on a relation who has only enough for
      herself. A girl can earn an honest living if she tries; and I mean to try&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what she said. I admired her independence,&rdquo; her Ladyship proceeded,
      ascending again to the higher regions of thought and expression. &ldquo;My
      niece&rsquo;s marriage, just at that time, had left me alone in this great
      house. I proposed to Isabel to come to me as companion and reader for a
      few weeks, and to decide for herself whether she liked the life or not. We
      have never been separated since that time. I could hardly be fonder of her
      if she were my own daughter; and she returns my affection with all her
      heart. She has excellent qualities&mdash;prudent, cheerful,
      sweet-tempered; with good sense enough to understand what her place is in
      the world, as distinguished from her place in my regard. I have taken
      care, for her own sake, never to leave that part of the question in any
      doubt. It would be cruel kindness to deceive her as to her future position
      when she marries. I shall take good care that the man who pays his
      addresses to her is a man in her rank of life. I know but too well, in the
      case of one of my own relatives, what miseries unequal marriages bring
      with them. Excuse me for troubling you at this length on domestic matters.
      I am very fond of Isabel; and a girl&rsquo;s head is so easily turned. Now you
      know what her position really is, you will also know what limits there
      must be to the expression of your interest in her. I am sure we understand
      each other; and I say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman listened to this long harangue with the immovable gravity which
      was part of his character&mdash;except when Isabel had taken him by
      surprise. When her Ladyship gave him the opportunity of speaking on his
      side, he had very little to say, and that little did not suggest that he
      had greatly profited by what he had heard. His mind had been full of
      Isabel when Lady Lydiard began, and it remained just as full of her, in
      just the same way, when Lady Lydiard had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he remarked quietly, &ldquo;Miss Isabel is an uncommonly nice girl, as
      you say. Very pretty, and such frank, unaffected manners. I don&rsquo;t deny
      that I feel an interest in her. The young ladies one meets in society are
      not much to my taste. Miss Isabel is my taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s face assumed a look of blank dismay. &ldquo;I am afraid I have
      failed to convey my exact meaning to you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman gravely declared that he understood her perfectly. &ldquo;Perfectly!&rdquo;
       he repeated, with his impenetrable obstinacy. &ldquo;Your Ladyship exactly
      expresses my opinion of Miss Isabel. Prudent, and cheerful, and
      sweet-tempered, as you say&mdash;all the qualities in a woman that I
      admire. With good looks, too&mdash;of course, with good looks. She will be
      a perfect treasure (as you remarked just now) to the man who marries her.
      I may claim to know something about it. I have twice narrowly escaped
      being married myself; and, though I can&rsquo;t exactly explain it, I&rsquo;m all the
      harder to please in consequence. Miss Isabel pleases me. I think I have
      said that before? Pardon me for saying it again. I&rsquo;ll call again to-morrow
      morning and look at the dog as early as eleven o&rsquo;clock, if you will allow
      me. Later in the day I must be off to France to attend a sale of horses.
      Glad to have been of any use to your Ladyship, I am sure. Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard let him go, wisely resigning any further attempt to establish
      an understanding between her visitor and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is either a person of very limited intelligence when he is away from
      his stables,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;or he deliberately declines to take a plain
      hint when it is given to him. I can&rsquo;t drop his acquaintance, on Tommie&rsquo;s
      account. The only other alternative is to keep Isabel out of his way. My
      good little girl shall not drift into a false position while I am living
      to look after her. When Mr. Hardyman calls to-morrow she shall be out on
      an errand. When he calls the next time she shall be upstairs with a
      headache. And if he tries it again she shall be away at my house in the
      country. If he makes any remarks on her absence&mdash;well, he will find
      that I can be just as dull of understanding as he is when the occasion
      calls for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having arrived at this satisfactory solution of the difficulty, Lady
      Lydiard became conscious of an irresistible impulse to summon Isabel to
      her presence and caress her. In the nature of a warm-hearted woman, this
      was only the inevitable reaction which followed the subsidence of anxiety
      about the girl, after her own resolution had set that anxiety at rest. She
      threw open the door and made one of her sudden appearances at the boudoir.
      Even in the fervent outpouring of her affection, there was still the
      inherent abruptness of manner which so strongly marked Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s
      character in all the relations of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I give you a kiss, this morning?&rdquo; she asked, when Isabel rose to
      receive her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lady,&rdquo; said the girl, with her charming smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then, and give me a kiss in return. Do you love me? Very well,
      then, treat me like your mother. Never mind &lsquo;my lady&rsquo; this time. Give me a
      good hug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in those homely words, or something perhaps in the look that
      accompanied them, touched sympathies in Isabel which seldom showed
      themselves on the surface. Her smiling lips trembled, the bright tears
      rose in her eyes. &ldquo;You are too good to me,&rdquo; she murmured, with her head on
      Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s bosom. &ldquo;How can I ever love you enough in return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard patted the pretty head that rested on her with such filial
      tenderness. &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Go back and play with Tommie, my
      dear. We may be as fond of each other as we like; but we mustn&rsquo;t cry. God
      bless you! Go away&mdash;go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned aside quickly; her own eyes were moistening, and it was part of
      her character to be reluctant to let Isabel see it. &ldquo;Why have I made a
      fool of myself?&rdquo; she wondered, as she approached the drawing-room door.
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I am all the better for it. Odd, that Mr. Hardyman
      should have made me feel fonder of Isabel than ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With those reflections she re-entered the drawing-room&mdash;and suddenly
      checked herself with a start. &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; she exclaimed irritably,
      &ldquo;how you frightened me! Why was I not told you were here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having left the drawing-room in a state of solitude, Lady Lydiard on her
      return found herself suddenly confronted with a gentleman, mysteriously
      planted on the hearth-rug in her absence. The new visitor may be rightly
      described as a gray man. He had gray hair, eyebrows, and whiskers; he wore
      a gray coat, waistcoat, and trousers, and gray gloves. For the rest, his
      appearance was eminently suggestive of wealth and respectability and, in
      this case, appearances were really to be trusted. The gray man was no
      other than Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s legal adviser, Mr. Troy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret, my Lady, that I should have been so unfortunate as to startle
      you,&rdquo; he said, with a certain underlying embarrassment in his manner. &ldquo;I
      had the honor of sending word by Mr. Moody that I would call at this hour,
      on some matters of business connected with your Ladyship&rsquo;s house property.
      I presumed that you expected to find me here, waiting your pleasure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus far Lady Lydiard had listened to her legal adviser, fixing her eyes
      on his face in her usually frank, straightforward way. She now stopped him
      in the middle of a sentence, with a change of expression in her own face
      which was undisguisedly a change to alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize, Mr. Troy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am to blame for forgetting your
      appointment and for not keeping my nerves under proper control.&rdquo; She
      paused for a moment and took a seat before she said her next words. &ldquo;May I
      ask,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;if there is something unpleasant in the business that
      brings you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever, my Lady; mere formalities, which can wait till
      to-morrow or next day, if you wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s fingers drummed impatiently on the table. &ldquo;You have known
      me long enough, Mr. Troy, to know that I cannot endure suspense. You <i>have</i>
      something unpleasant to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer respectfully remonstrated. &ldquo;Really, Lady Lydiard!&mdash;&rdquo; he
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Mr. Troy! I know how you look at me on ordinary occasions,
      and I see how you look at me now. You are a very clever lawyer; but,
      happily for the interests that I commit to your charge, you are also a
      thoroughly honest man. After twenty years&rsquo; experience of you, you can&rsquo;t
      deceive <i>me</i>. You bring me bad news. Speak at once, sir, and speak
      plainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy yielded&mdash;inch by inch, as it were. &ldquo;I bring news which, I
      fear, may annoy your Ladyship.&rdquo; He paused, and advanced another inch. &ldquo;It
      is news which I only became acquainted with myself on entering this
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited again, and made another advance. &ldquo;I happened to meet your
      Ladyship&rsquo;s steward, Mr. Moody, in the hall&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Lady Lydiard interposed angrily. &ldquo;I can make <i>him</i>
      speak out, and I will. Send him here instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer made a last effort to hold off the coming disclosure a little
      longer. &ldquo;Mr. Moody will be here directly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mr. Moody requested
      me to prepare your Ladyship&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ring the bell, Mr. Troy, or must I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody had evidently been waiting outside while the lawyer spoke for him.
      He saved Mr. Troy the trouble of ringing the bell by presenting himself in
      the drawing-room. Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s eyes searched his face as he approached.
      Her bright complexion faded suddenly. Not a word more passed her lips. She
      looked, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence on his part, Moody laid an open sheet of paper on the table.
      The paper quivered in his trembling hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard recovered herself first. &ldquo;Is that for me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took up the paper without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation. Both the men
      watched her anxiously as she read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The handwriting was strange to her. The words were these:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hereby certify that the bearer of these lines, Robert Moody by name,
      has presented to me the letter with which he was charged, addressed to
      myself, with the seal intact. I regret to add that there is, to say the
      least of it, some mistake. The inclosure referred to by the anonymous
      writer of the letter, who signs &lsquo;a friend in need,&rsquo; has not reached me. No
      five-hundred pound bank-note was in the letter when I opened it. My wife
      was present when I broke the seal, and can certify to this statement if
      necessary. Not knowing who my charitable correspondent is (Mr. Moody being
      forbidden to give me any information), I can only take this means of
      stating the case exactly as it stands, and hold myself at the disposal of
      the writer of the letter. My private address is at the head of the page.&mdash;Samuel
      Bradstock, Rector, St. Anne&rsquo;s, Deansbury, London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard dropped the paper on the table. For the moment, plainly as
      the Rector&rsquo;s statement was expressed, she appeared to be incapable of
      understanding it. &ldquo;What, in God&rsquo;s name, does this mean?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer and the steward looked at each other. Which of the two was
      entitled to speak first? Lady Lydiard gave them no time to decide.
      &ldquo;Moody,&rdquo; she said sternly, &ldquo;you took charge of the letter&mdash;I look to
      you for an explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody&rsquo;s dark eyes flashed. He answered Lady Lydiard without caring to
      conceal that he resented the tone in which she had spoken to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I undertook to deliver the letter at its address,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I found it,
      sealed, on the table. Your Ladyship has the clergyman&rsquo;s written testimony
      that I handed it to him with the seal unbroken. I have done my duty; and I
      have no explanation to offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Lady Lydiard could speak again, Mr. Troy discreetly interfered. He
      saw plainly that his experience was required to lead the investigation in
      the right direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, my Lady,&rdquo; he said, with that happy mixture of the positive and
      the polite in his manner, of which lawyers alone possess the secret.
      &ldquo;There is only one way of arriving at the truth in painful matters of this
      sort. We must begin at the beginning. May I venture to ask your Ladyship a
      question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard felt the composing influence of Mr. Troy. &ldquo;I am at your
      disposal, sir,&rdquo; she said, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you absolutely certain that you inclosed the bank-note in the
      letter?&rdquo; the lawyer asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly believe I inclosed it,&rdquo; Lady Lydiard answered. &ldquo;But I was so
      alarmed at the time by the sudden illness of my dog, that I do not feel
      justified in speaking positively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was anybody in the room with your Ladyship when you put the inclosure in
      the letter&mdash;as you believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> was in the room,&rdquo; said Moody. &ldquo;I can swear that I saw her
      Ladyship put the bank-note in the letter, and the letter in the envelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And seal the envelope?&rdquo; asked Mr. Troy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Her Ladyship was called away into the next room to the dog,
      before she could seal the envelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy addressed himself once more to Lady Lydiard. &ldquo;Did your Ladyship
      take the letter into the next room with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was too much alarmed to think of it, Mr. Troy. I left it here, on the
      table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the envelope open?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long were you absent in the other room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour or more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Mr. Troy to himself. &ldquo;This complicates it a little.&rdquo; He
      reflected for a while, and then turned again to Moody. &ldquo;Did any of the
      servants know of this bank-note being in her Ladyship&rsquo;s possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one of them,&rdquo; Moody answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suspect any of the servants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any workmen employed in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know of any persons who had access to the room while Lady Lydiard
      was absent from it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two visitors called, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who were they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her Ladyship&rsquo;s nephew, Mr. Felix Sweetsir, and the Honorable Alfred
      Hardyman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy shook his head irritably. &ldquo;I am not speaking of gentlemen of high
      position and repute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd even to mention Mr. Sweetsir
      and Mr. Hardyman. My question related to strangers who might have obtained
      access to the drawing-room&mdash;people calling, with her Ladyship&rsquo;s
      sanction, for subscriptions, for instance; or people calling with articles
      of dress or ornament to be submitted to her Ladyship&rsquo;s inspection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such persons came to the house with my knowledge,&rdquo; Moody answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy suspended the investigation, and took a turn thoughtfully in the
      room. The theory on which his inquiries had proceeded thus far had failed
      to produce any results. His experience warned him to waste no more time on
      it, and to return to the starting-point of the investigation&mdash;in
      other words, to the letter. Shifting his point of view, he turned again to
      Lady Lydiard, and tried his questions in a new direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Moody mentioned just now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that your Ladyship was called
      into the next room before you could seal your letter. On your return to
      this room, did you seal the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was busy with the dog,&rdquo; Lady Lydiard answered. &ldquo;Isabel Miller was of no
      use in the boudoir, and I told her to seal it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy started. The new direction in which he was pushing his inquiries
      began to look like the right direction already. &ldquo;Miss Isabel Miller,&rdquo; he
      proceeded, &ldquo;has been a resident under your Ladyship&rsquo;s roof for some little
      time, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For nearly two years, Mr. Troy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As your Ladyship&rsquo;s companion and reader?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As my adopted daughter,&rdquo; her Ladyship answered, with marked emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wise Mr. Troy rightly interpreted the emphasis as a warning to him to
      suspend the examination of her Ladyship, and to address to Mr. Moody the
      far more serious questions which were now to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did anyone give you the letter before you left the house with it?&rdquo; he
      said to the steward. &ldquo;Or did you take it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took it myself, from the table here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it sealed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was anybody present when you took the letter from the table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Isabel was present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find her alone in the room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard opened her lips to speak, and checked herself. Mr. Troy,
      having cleared the ground before him, put the fatal question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Moody,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when Miss Isabel was instructed to seal the letter,
      did she know that a bank-note was inclosed in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of replying, Robert drew back from the lawyer with a look of
      horror. Lady Lydiard started to her feet&mdash;and checked herself again,
      on the point of speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer him, Moody,&rdquo; she said, putting a strong constraint on herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert answered very unwillingly. &ldquo;I took the liberty of reminding her
      ladyship that she had left her letter unsealed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I mentioned
      as my excuse for speaking,&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped, and corrected himself&mdash;&ldquo;<i>I
      believe</i> I mentioned that a valuable inclosure was in the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe?&rdquo; Mr. Troy repeated. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you speak more positively than
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> can speak positively,&rdquo; said Lady Lydiard, with her eyes on the
      lawyer. &ldquo;Moody did mention the inclosure in the letter&mdash;in Isabel
      Miller&rsquo;s hearing as well as in mine.&rdquo; She paused, steadily controlling
      herself. &ldquo;And what of that, Mr. Troy?&rdquo; she added, very quietly and firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy answered quietly and firmly, on his side. &ldquo;I am surprised that
      your Ladyship should ask the question,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I persist in repeating the question,&rdquo; Lady Lydiard rejoined. &ldquo;I say that
      Isabel Miller knew of the inclosure in my letter&mdash;and I ask, What of
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I answer,&rdquo; retorted the impenetrable lawyer, &ldquo;that the suspicion of
      theft rests on your Ladyship&rsquo;s adopted daughter, and on nobody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s false!&rdquo; cried Robert, with a burst of honest indignation. &ldquo;I wish to
      God I had never said a word to you about the loss of the bank-note! Oh, my
      Lady! my Lady! don&rsquo;t let him distress you! What does <i>he</i> know about
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Lady Lydiard. &ldquo;Control yourself, and hear what he has to
      say.&rdquo; She rested her hand on Moody&rsquo;s shoulder, partly to encourage him,
      partly to support herself; and, fixing her eyes again on Mr. Troy,
      repeated his last words, &ldquo;&lsquo;Suspicion rests on my adopted daughter, and on
      nobody else.&rsquo; Why on nobody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your Ladyship prepared to suspect the Rector of St. Anne&rsquo;s of
      embezzlement, or your own relatives and equals of theft?&rdquo; Mr. Troy asked.
      &ldquo;Does a shadow of doubt rest on the servants? Not if Mr. Moody&rsquo;s evidence
      is to be believed. Who, to our own certain knowledge, had access to the
      letter while it was unsealed? Who was alone in the room with it? And who
      knew of the inclosure in it? I leave the answer to your Ladyship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isabel Miller is as incapable of an act of theft as I am. There is my
      answer, Mr. Troy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer bowed resignedly, and advanced to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to take your Ladyship&rsquo;s generous assertion as finally disposing of
      the question of the lost bank-note?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard met the challenge without shrinking from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The loss of the bank-note is known out of my house. Other
      persons may suspect this innocent girl as you suspect her. It is due to
      Isabel&rsquo;s reputation&mdash;her unstained reputation, Mr. Troy!&mdash;that
      she should know what has happened, and should have an opportunity of
      defending herself. She is in the next room, Moody. Bring her here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robert&rsquo;s courage failed him: he trembled at the bare idea of exposing
      Isabel to the terrible ordeal that awaited her. &ldquo;Oh, my Lady!&rdquo; he pleaded,
      &ldquo;think again before you tell the poor girl that she is suspected of theft.
      Keep it a secret from her&mdash;the shame of it will break her heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it a secret,&rdquo; said Lady Lydiard, &ldquo;when the Rector and the Rector&rsquo;s
      wife both know of it! Do you think they will let the matter rest where it
      is, even if I could consent to hush it up? I must write to them; and I
      can&rsquo;t write anonymously after what has happened. Put yourself in Isabel&rsquo;s
      place, and tell me if you would thank the person who knew you to be
      innocently exposed to a disgraceful suspicion, and who concealed it from
      you? Go, Moody! The longer you delay, the harder it will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his head sunk on his breast, with anguish written in every line of
      his face, Moody obeyed. Passing slowly down the short passage which
      connected the two rooms, and still shrinking from the duty that had been
      imposed on him, he paused, looking through the curtains which hung over
      the entrance to the boudoir.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE sight that met Moody&rsquo;s view wrung him to the heart.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Isabel and the dog were at play together. Among the varied accomplishments
      possessed by Tommie, the capacity to take his part at a game of
      hide-and-seek was one. His playfellow for the time being put a shawl or a
      handkerchief over his head, so as to prevent him from seeing, and then hid
      among the furniture a pocketbook, or a cigar-case, or a purse, or anything
      else that happened to be at hand, leaving the dog to find it, with his
      keen sense of smell to guide him. Doubly relieved by the fit and the
      bleeding, Tommie&rsquo;s spirits had revived; and he and Isabel had just begun
      their game when Moody looked into the room, charged with his terrible
      errand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re burning, Tommie, you&rsquo;re burning!&rdquo; cried the girl, laughing
      and clapping her hands. The next moment she happened to look round and saw
      Moody through the parted curtains. His face warned her instantly that
      something serious had happened. She advanced a few steps, her eyes resting
      on him in silent alarm. He was himself too painfully agitated to speak.
      Not a word was exchanged between Lady Lydiard and Mr. Troy in the next
      room. In the complete stillness that prevailed, the dog was heard sniffing
      and fidgeting about the furniture. Robert took Isabel by the hand and led
      her into the drawing-room. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, spare her, my Lady!&rdquo; he
      whispered. The lawyer heard him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Troy. &ldquo;Be merciful, and
      tell her the truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to a woman who stood in no need of his advice. The inherent
      nobility in Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s nature was aroused: her great heart offered
      itself patiently to any sorrow, to any sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting her arm round Isabel&mdash;half caressing her, half supporting her&mdash;Lady
      Lydiard accepted the whole responsibility and told the whole truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reeling under the first shock, the poor girl recovered herself with
      admirable courage. She raised her head, and eyed the lawyer without
      uttering a word. In its artless consciousness of innocence the look was
      nothing less than sublime. Addressing herself to Mr. Troy, Lady Lydiard
      pointed to Isabel. &ldquo;Do you see guilt there?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy made no answer. In the melancholy experience of humanity to which
      his profession condemned him, he had seen conscious guilt assume the face
      of innocence, and helpless innocence admit the disguise of guilt: the
      keenest observation, in either case, failing completely to detect the
      truth. Lady Lydiard misinterpreted his silence as expressing the sullen
      self-assertion of a heartless man. She turned from him, in contempt, and
      held out her hand to Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Troy is not satisfied yet,&rdquo; she said bitterly. &ldquo;My love, take my
      hand, and look me in the face as your equal; I know no difference of rank
      at such a time as this. Before God, who hears you, are you innocent of the
      theft of the bank-note?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before God, who hears me,&rdquo; Isabel answered, &ldquo;I am innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard looked once more at the lawyer, and waited to hear if he
      believed <i>that</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy took refuge in dumb diplomacy&mdash;he made a low bow. It might
      have meant that he believed Isabel, or it might have meant that he
      modestly withdrew his own opinion into the background. Lady Lydiard did
      not condescend to inquire what it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner we bring this painful scene to an end the better,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;I shall be glad to avail myself of your professional assistance, Mr.
      Troy, within certain limits. Outside of my house, I beg that you will
      spare no trouble in tracing the lost money to the person who has really
      stolen it. Inside of my house, I must positively request that the
      disappearance of the note may never be alluded to, in any way whatever,
      until your inquiries have been successful in discovering the thief. In the
      meanwhile, Mrs. Tollmidge and her family must not be sufferers by my loss:
      I shall pay the money again.&rdquo; She paused, and pressed Isabel&rsquo;s hand with
      affectionate fervor. &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;one last word to you, and I
      have done. You remain here, with my trust in you, and my love for you,
      absolutely unshaken. When you think of what has been said here to-day,
      never forget that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel bent her head, and kissed the kind hand that still held hers. The
      high spirit that was in her, inspired by Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s example, rose
      equal to the dreadful situation in which she was placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my Lady,&rdquo; she said calmly and sadly; &ldquo;it cannot be. What this
      gentleman has said of me is not to be denied&mdash;the appearances are
      against me. The letter was open, and I was alone in the room with it, and
      Mr. Moody told me that a valuable inclosure was inside it. Dear and kind
      mistress! I am not fit to be a member of your household, I am not worthy
      to live with the honest people who serve you, while my innocence is in
      doubt. It is enough for me now that <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t doubt it. I can wait
      patiently, after that, for the day that gives me back my good name. Oh, my
      Lady, don&rsquo;t cry about it! Pray, pray don&rsquo;t cry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s self-control failed her for the first time. Isabel&rsquo;s
      courage had made Isabel dearer to her than ever. She sank into a chair,
      and covered her face with her handkerchief. Mr. Troy turned aside
      abruptly, and examined a Japanese vase, without any idea in his mind of
      what he was looking at. Lady Lydiard had gravely misjudged him in
      believing him to be a heartless man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel followed the lawyer, and touched him gently on the arm to rouse his
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have one relation living, sir&mdash;an aunt&mdash;who will receive me
      if I go to her,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;Is there any harm in my going? Lady
      Lydiard will give you the address when you want me. Spare her Ladyship,
      sir, all the pain and trouble that you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last the heart that was in Mr. Troy asserted itself. &ldquo;You are a fine
      creature!&rdquo; he said, with a burst of enthusiasm. &ldquo;I agree with Lady Lydiard&mdash;I
      believe you are innocent, too; and I will leave no effort untried to find
      the proof of it.&rdquo; He turned aside again, and had another look at the
      Japanese vase.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the lawyer withdrew himself from observation, Moody approached Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far he had stood apart, watching her and listening to her in silence.
      Not a look that had crossed her face, not a word that had fallen from her,
      had escaped him. Unconsciously on her side, unconsciously on his side, she
      now wrought on his nature with a purifying and ennobling influence which
      animated it with a new life. All that had been selfish and violent in his
      passion for her left him to return no more. The immeasurable devotion
      which he laid at her feet, in the days that were yet to come&mdash;the
      unyielding courage which cheerfully accepted the sacrifice of himself when
      events demanded it at a later period of his life&mdash;struck root in him
      now. Without attempting to conceal the tears that were falling fast over
      his cheeks&mdash;striving vainly to express those new thoughts in him that
      were beyond the reach of words&mdash;he stood before her the truest friend
      and servant that ever woman had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear! my heart is heavy for you. Take me to serve you and help
      you. Her Ladyship&rsquo;s kindness will permit it, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could say no more. In those simple words the cry of his heart reached
      her. &ldquo;Forgive me, Robert,&rdquo; she answered, gratefully, &ldquo;if I said anything
      to pain you when we spoke together a little while since. I didn&rsquo;t mean
      it.&rdquo; She gave him her hand, and looked timidly over her shoulder at Lady
      Lydiard. &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; she said, in low, broken tones, &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy heard her, and stepped forward to interfere before Lady Lydiard
      could speak. The man had recovered his self-control; the lawyer took his
      place again on the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not leave us, my dear,&rdquo; he said to Isabel, &ldquo;until I have put a
      question to Mr. Moody in which you are interested. Do you happen to have
      the number of the lost bank-note?&rdquo; he asked, turning to the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moody produced his slip of paper with the number on it. Mr. Troy made two
      copies of it before he returned the paper. One copy he put in his pocket,
      the other he handed to Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it carefully,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Neither you nor I know how soon it may be
      of use to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Receiving the copy from him, she felt mechanically in her apron for her
      pocketbook. She had used it, in playing with the dog, as an object to hide
      from him; but she had suffered, and was still suffering, too keenly to be
      capable of the effort of remembrance. Moody, eager to help her even in the
      most trifling thing, guessed what had happened. &ldquo;You were playing with
      Tommie,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;is it in the next room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog heard his name pronounced through the open door. The next moment
      he trotted into the drawing-room with Isabel&rsquo;s pocketbook in his mouth. He
      was a strong, well-grown Scotch terrier of the largest size, with bright,
      intelligent eyes, and a coat of thick curling white hair, diversified by
      two light brown patches on his back. As he reached the middle of the room,
      and looked from one to another of the persons present, the fine sympathy
      of his race told him that there was trouble among his human friends. His
      tail dropped; he whined softly as he approached Isabel, and laid her
      pocketbook at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt as she picked up the pocketbook, and raised her playfellow of
      happier days to take her leave of him. As the dog put his paws on her
      shoulders, returning her caress, her first tears fell. &ldquo;Foolish of me,&rdquo;
       she said, faintly, &ldquo;to cry over a dog. I can&rsquo;t help it. Good-by, Tommie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Putting him away from her gently, she walked towards the door. The dog
      instantly followed. She put him away from her, for the second time, and
      left him. He was not to be denied; he followed her again, and took the
      skirt of her dress in his teeth, as if to hold her back. Robert forced the
      dog, growling and resisting with all his might, to let go of the dress.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rough with him,&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;Put him on her ladyship&rsquo;s lap; he
      will be quieter there.&rdquo; Robert obeyed. He whispered to Lady Lydiard as she
      received the dog; she seemed to be still incapable of speaking&mdash;she
      bowed her head in silent assent. Robert hurried back to Isabel before she
      had passed the door. &ldquo;Not alone!&rdquo; he said entreatingly. &ldquo;Her Ladyship
      permits it, Isabel. Let me see you safe to your aunt&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel looked at him, felt for him, and yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered softly; &ldquo;to make amends for what I said to you when I
      was thoughtless and happy!&rdquo; She waited a little to compose herself before
      she spoke her farewell words to Lady Lydiard. &ldquo;Good-by, my Lady. Your
      kindness has not been thrown away on an ungrateful girl. I love you, and
      thank you, with all my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard rose, placing the dog on the chair as she left it. She seemed
      to have grown older by years, instead of by minutes, in the short interval
      that had passed since she had hidden her face from view. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear
      it!&rdquo; she cried, in husky, broken tones. &ldquo;Isabel! Isabel! I forbid you to
      leave me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But one person could venture to resist her. That person was Mr. Troy&mdash;and
      Mr. Troy knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Control yourself,&rdquo; he said to her in a whisper. &ldquo;The girl is doing what
      is best and most becoming in her position&mdash;and is doing it with a
      patience and courage wonderful to see. She places herself under the
      protection of her nearest relative, until her character is vindicated and
      her position in your house is once more beyond a doubt. Is this a time to
      throw obstacles in her way? Be worthy of yourself, Lady Lydiard and think
      of the day when she will return to you without the breath of a suspicion
      to rest on her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no disputing with him&mdash;he was too plainly in the right.
      Lady Lydiard submitted; she concealed the torture that her own resolution
      inflicted on her with an endurance which was, indeed, worthy of herself.
      Taking Isabel in her arms she kissed her in a passion of sorrow and love.
      &ldquo;My poor dear! My own sweet girl! don&rsquo;t suppose that this is a parting
      kiss! I shall see you again&mdash;often and often I shall see you again at
      your aunt&rsquo;s!&rdquo; At a sign from Mr. Troy, Robert took Isabel&rsquo;s arm in his and
      led her away. Tommie, watching her from his chair, lifted his little white
      muzzle as his playfellow looked back on passing the doorway. The long,
      melancholy, farewell howl of the dog was the last sound Isabel Miller
      heard as she left the house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON the day after Isabel&rsquo;s departure, diligent Mr. Troy set forth for the
      Head Office in Whitehall to consult the police on the question of the
      missing money. He had previously sent information of the robbery to the
      Bank of England, and had also advertised the loss in the daily newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was so pleasant, and the sun was so bright, that he determined on
      proceeding to his destination on foot. He was hardly out of sight of his
      own offices when he was overtaken by a friend, who was also walking in the
      direction of Whitehall. This gentleman was a person of considerable
      worldly wisdom and experience; he had been officially associated with
      cases of striking and notorious crime, in which Government had lent its
      assistance to discover and punish the criminals. The opinion of a person
      in this position might be of the greatest value to Mr. Troy, whose
      practice as a solicitor had thus far never brought him into collision with
      thieves and mysteries. He accordingly decided, in Isabel&rsquo;s interests, on
      confiding to his friend the nature of his errand to the police. Concealing
      the name, but concealing nothing else, he described what had happened on
      the previous day at Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house, and then put the question
      plainly to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do in my place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your place,&rdquo; his friend answered quietly, &ldquo;I should not waste time and
      money in consulting the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not consult the police!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Troy in amazement. &ldquo;Surely, I have
      not made myself understood? I am going to the Head Office; and I have got
      a letter of introduction to the chief inspector in the detective
      department. I am afraid I omitted to mention that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; proceeded the other, as coolly as ever.
      &ldquo;You have asked for my advice, and I give you my advice. Tear up your
      letter of introduction, and don&rsquo;t stir a step further in the direction of
      Whitehall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy began to understand. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in the detective police?&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who <i>can</i> believe in them, who reads his newspaper and remembers
      what he reads?&rdquo; his friend rejoined. &ldquo;Fortunately for the detective
      department, the public in general forgets what it reads. Go to your club,
      and look at the criminal history of our own time, recorded in the
      newspapers. Every crime is more or less a mystery. You will see that the
      mysteries which the police discover are, almost without exception,
      mysteries made penetrable by the commonest capacity, through the
      extraordinary stupidity exhibited in the means taken to hide the crime. On
      the other hand, let the guilty man or woman be a resolute and intelligent
      person, capable of setting his (or her) wits fairly against the wits of
      the police&mdash;in other words, let the mystery really <i>be</i> a
      mystery&mdash;and cite me a case if you can (a really difficult and
      perplexing case) in which the criminal has not escaped. Mind! I don&rsquo;t
      charge the police with neglecting their work. No doubt they do their best,
      and take the greatest pains in following the routine to which they have
      been trained. It is their misfortune, not their fault, that there is no
      man of superior intelligence among them&mdash;I mean no man who is
      capable, in great emergencies, of placing himself above conventional
      methods, and following a new way of his own. There have been such men in
      the police&mdash;men naturally endowed with that faculty of mental
      analysis which can decompose a mystery, resolve it into its component
      parts, and find the clue at the bottom, no matter how remote from ordinary
      observation it may be. But those men have died, or have retired. One of
      them would have been invaluable to you in the case you have just mentioned
      to me. As things are, unless you are wrong in believing in the young
      lady&rsquo;s innocence, the person who has stolen that bank-note will be no easy
      person to find. In my opinion, there is only one man now in London who is
      likely to be of the slightest assistance to you&mdash;and he is not in the
      police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked Mr. Troy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old rogue, who was once in your branch of the legal profession,&rdquo; the
      friend answered. &ldquo;You may, perhaps, remember the name: they call him &lsquo;Old
      Sharon.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! The scoundrel who was struck off the Roll of Attorneys, years
      since? Is he still alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive and prospering. He lives in a court or lane running out of Long
      Acre, and he offers advice to persons interested in recovering missing
      objects of any sort. Whether you have lost your wife, or lost your
      cigar-case, Old Sharon is equally useful to you. He has an inbred capacity
      for reading the riddle the right way in cases of mystery, great or small.
      In short, he possesses exactly that analytical faculty to which I alluded
      just now. I have his address at my office, if you think it worth while to
      try him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can trust such a man?&rdquo; Mr. Troy objected. &ldquo;He would be sure to
      deceive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are entirely mistaken. Since he was struck off the Rolls Old Sharon
      has discovered that the straight way is, on the whole, the best way, even
      in a man&rsquo;s own interests. His consultation fee is a guinea; and he gives a
      signed estimate beforehand for any supplementary expenses that may follow.
      I can tell you (this is, of course, strictly between ourselves) that the
      authorities at my office took his advice in a Government case that puzzled
      the police. We approached him, of course, through persons who were to be
      trusted to represent us, without betraying the source from which their
      instructions were derived; and we found the old rascal&rsquo;s advice well worth
      paying for. It is quite likely that he may not succeed so well in your
      case. Try the police, by all means; and, if they fail, why, there is
      Sharon as a last resort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement commended itself to Mr. Troy&rsquo;s professional caution. He
      went on to Whitehall, and he tried the detective police.
    </p>
    <p>
      They at once adopted the obvious conclusion to persons of ordinary
      capacity&mdash;the conclusion that Isabel was the thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting on this conviction, the authorities sent an experienced woman from
      the office to Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house, to examine the poor girl&rsquo;s clothes and
      ornaments before they were packed up and sent after her to her aunt&rsquo;s. The
      search led to nothing. The only objects of any value that were discovered
      had been presents from Lady Lydiard. No jewelers&rsquo; or milliners&rsquo; bills were
      among the papers found in her desk. Not a sign of secret extravagance in
      dress was to be seen anywhere. Defeated so far, the police proposed next
      to have Isabel privately watched. There might be a prodigal lover
      somewhere in the background, with ruin staring him in the face unless he
      could raise five hundred pounds. Lady Lydiard (who had only consented to
      the search under stress of persuasive argument from Mr. Troy) resented
      this ingenious idea as an insult. She declared that if Isabel was watched
      the girl should know of it instantly from her own lips. The police
      listened with perfect resignation and decorum, and politely shifted their
      ground. A certain suspicion (they remarked) always rested in cases of this
      sort on the servants. Would her Ladyship object to private inquiries into
      the characters and proceedings of the servants? Her Ladyship instantly
      objected, in the most positive terms. Thereupon the &ldquo;Inspector&rdquo; asked for
      a minute&rsquo;s private conversation with Mr. Troy. &ldquo;The thief is certainly a
      member of Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s household,&rdquo; this functionary remarked, in his
      politely-positive way. &ldquo;If her Ladyship persists in refusing to let us
      make the necessary inquiries, our hands are tied, and the case comes to an
      end through no fault of ours. If her Ladyship changes her mind, perhaps
      you will drop me a line, sir, to that effect. Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the experiment of consulting the police came to an untimely end. The
      one result obtained was the expression of purblind opinion by the
      authorities of the detective department which pointed to Isabel, or to one
      of the servants, as the undiscovered thief. Thinking the matter over in
      the retirement of his own office&mdash;and not forgetting his promise to
      Isabel to leave no means untried of establishing her innocence&mdash;Mr.
      Troy could see but one alternative left to him. He took up his pen, and
      wrote to his friend at the Government office. There was nothing for it now
      but to run the risk, and try Old Sharon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE next day, Mr. Troy (taking Robert Moody with him as a valuable
      witness) rang the bell at the mean and dirty lodging-house in which Old
      Sharon received the clients who stood in need of his advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were led up stairs to a back room on the second floor of the house.
      Entering the room, they discovered through a thick cloud of tobacco smoke,
      a small, fat, bald-headed, dirty, old man, in an arm-chair, robed in a
      tattered flannel dressing-gown, with a short pipe in his mouth, a pug-dog
      on his lap, and a French novel in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it business?&rdquo; asked Old Sharon, speaking in a hoarse, asthmatical
      voice, and fixing a pair of bright, shameless, black eyes attentively on
      the two visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> business,&rdquo; Mr. Troy answered, looking at the old rogue who
      had disgraced an honorable profession, as he might have looked at a
      reptile which had just risen rampant at his feet. &ldquo;What is your fee for a
      consultation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give me a guinea, and I&rsquo;ll give you half an hour.&rdquo; With this reply
      Old Sharon held out his unwashed hand across the rickety ink-splashed
      table at which he was sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy would not have touched him with the tips of his own fingers for a
      thousand pounds. He laid the guinea on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sharon burst into a fierce laugh&mdash;a laugh strangely accompanied
      by a frowning contraction of his eyebrows, and a frightful exhibition of
      the whole inside of his mouth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not clean enough for you&mdash;eh?&rdquo; he
      said, with an appearance of being very much amused. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dirty old
      man described in this book that is a little like me.&rdquo; He held up his
      French novel. &ldquo;Have you read it? A capital story&mdash;well put together.
      Ah, you haven&rsquo;t read it? You have got a pleasure to come. I say, do you
      mind tobacco-smoke? I think faster while I smoke&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy&rsquo;s respectable hand waved a silent permission to smoke, given
      under dignified protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Old Sharon. &ldquo;Now, get on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid himself back in his chair, and puffed out his smoke, with eyes
      lazily half closed, like the eyes of the pug-dog on his lap. At that
      moment, indeed there was a curious resemblance between the two. They both
      seemed to be preparing themselves, in the same idle way, for the same
      comfortable nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy stated the circumstances under which the five hundred pound note
      had disappeared, in clear and consecutive narrative. When he had done, Old
      Sharon suddenly opened his eyes. The pug-dog suddenly opened his eyes. Old
      Sharon looked hard at Mr. Troy. The pug looked hard at Mr. Troy. Old
      Sharon spoke. The pug growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know who you are&mdash;you&rsquo;re a lawyer. Don&rsquo;t be alarmed! I never saw
      you before; and I don&rsquo;t know your name. What I do know is a lawyer&rsquo;s
      statement of facts when I hear it. Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Old Sharon looked
      inquisitively at Moody as he put the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy introduced Moody as a competent witness, thoroughly acquainted
      with the circumstances, and ready and willing to answer any questions
      relating to them. Old Sharon waited a little, smoking hard and thinking
      hard. &ldquo;Now, then!&rdquo; he burst out in his fiercely sudden way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
      get to the root of the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned forward with his elbows on the table, and began his examination
      of Moody. Heartily as Mr. Troy despised and disliked the old rogue, he
      listened with astonishment and admiration&mdash;literally extorted from
      him by the marvelous ability with which the questions were adapted to the
      end in view. In a quarter of an hour Old Sharon had extracted from the
      witness everything, literally everything down to the smallest detail, that
      Moody could tell him. Having now, in his own phrase, &ldquo;got to the root of
      the matter,&rdquo; he relighted his pipe with a grunt of satisfaction, and laid
      himself back in his old armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mr. Troy. &ldquo;Have you formed your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ve formed my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of replying, Old Sharon winked confidentially at Mr. Troy, and put
      a question on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say! is a ten-pound note much of an object to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on what the money is wanted for,&rdquo; answered Mr. Troy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Old Sharon; &ldquo;I give you an opinion for your guinea; but,
      mind this, it&rsquo;s an opinion founded on hearsay&mdash;and you know as a
      lawyer what that is worth. Venture your ten pounds&mdash;in plain English,
      pay me for my time and trouble in a baffling and difficult case&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;ll give you an opinion founded on my own experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself a little more clearly,&rdquo; said Mr. Troy. &ldquo;What do you
      guarantee to tell us if we venture the ten pounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guarantee to name the person, or the persons, on whom the suspicion
      really rests. And if you employ me after that, I guarantee (before you pay
      me a halfpenny more) to prove that I am right by laying my hand on the
      thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us have the guinea opinion first,&rdquo; said Mr. Troy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sharon made another frightful exhibition of the whole inside of his
      mouth; his laugh was louder and fiercer than ever. &ldquo;I like you!&rdquo; he said
      to Mr. Troy, &ldquo;you are so devilish fond of your money. Lord! how rich you
      must be! Now listen. Here&rsquo;s the guinea opinion: Suspect, in this case, the
      very last person on whom suspicion could possibly fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody, listening attentively, started, and changed color at those last
      words. Mr. Troy looked thoroughly disappointed and made no attempt to
      conceal it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All?&rdquo; retorted the cynical vagabond. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty lawyer! What more
      can I say, when I don&rsquo;t know for certain whether the witness who has given
      me my information has misled me or not? Have I spoken to the girl and
      formed my own opinion? No! Have I been introduced among the servants (as
      errand-boy, or to clean the boots and shoes, or what not), and have I
      formed my own judgement of <i>them?</i> No! I take your opinions for
      granted, and I tell you how I should set to work myself if they were <i>my</i>
      opinions too&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a guinea&rsquo;s-worth, a devilish good
      guinea&rsquo;s-worth to a rich man like you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Sharon&rsquo;s logic produced a certain effect on Mr. Troy, in spite of
      himself. It was smartly put from his point of view&mdash;there was no
      denying that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if I consented to your proposal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should object to your
      annoying the young lady with impertinent questions, or to your being
      introduced as a spy into a respectable house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Sharon doubled his dirty fists and drummed with them on the rickety
      table in a comical frenzy of impatience while Mr. Troy was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do you know about my way of doing my business?&rdquo; he burst
      out when the lawyer had done. &ldquo;One of us two is talking like a born idiot&mdash;and
      (mind this) it isn&rsquo;t me. Look here! Your young lady goes out for a walk,
      and she meets with a dirty, shabby old beggar&mdash;I look like a shabby
      old beggar already, don&rsquo;t I? Very good. This dirty old wretch whines and
      whimpers and tells a long story, and gets sixpence out of the girl&mdash;and
      knows her by that time, inside and out, as well as if he had made her&mdash;and,
      mark! hasn&rsquo;t asked her a single question, and, instead of annoying her,
      has made her happy in the performance of a charitable action. Stop a bit!
      I haven&rsquo;t done with you yet. Who blacks your boots and shoes? Look here!&rdquo;
       He pushed his pug-dog off his lap, dived under the table, appeared again
      with an old boot and a bottle of blackening, and set to work with tigerish
      activity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out for a walk, you know, and I may as well make
      myself smart.&rdquo; With that announcement, he began to sing over his work&mdash;a
      song of sentiment, popular in England in the early part of the present
      century&mdash;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all my fancy painted her; she&rsquo;s lovely, she&rsquo;s divine;
      but her heart it is another&rsquo;s; and it never can be mine!
      Too-ral-loo-ral-loo&rsquo;. I like a love-song. Brush away! brush away! till I
      see my own pretty face in the blacking. Hey! Here&rsquo;s a nice, harmless,
      jolly old man! sings and jokes over his work, and makes the kitchen quite
      cheerful. What&rsquo;s that you say? He&rsquo;s a stranger, and don&rsquo;t talk to him too
      freely. You ought to be ashamed of yourself to speak in that way of a poor
      old fellow with one foot in the grave. Mrs. Cook will give him a nice bit
      of dinner in the scullery; and John Footman will look out an old coat for
      him. And when he&rsquo;s heard everything he wants to hear, and doesn&rsquo;t come
      back again the next day to his work&mdash;what do they think of it in the
      servants&rsquo; hall? Do they say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve had a spy among us!&rsquo; Yah! you know
      better than that, by this time. The cheerful old man has been run over in
      the street, or is down with the fever, or has turned up his toes in the
      parish dead-house&mdash;that&rsquo;s what they say in the servants&rsquo; hall. Try me
      in your own kitchen, and see if your servants take me for a spy. Come,
      come, Mr. Lawyer! out with your ten pounds, and don&rsquo;t waste any more
      precious time about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will consider and let you know,&rdquo; said Mr. Troy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sharon laughed more ferociously than ever, and hobbled round the table
      in a great hurry to the place at which Moody was sitting. He laid one hand
      on the steward&rsquo;s shoulder, and pointed derisively with the other to Mr.
      Troy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Mr. Silent-man! Bet you five pounds I never hear of that lawyer
      again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silently attentive all through the interview (except when he was answering
      questions), Moody only replied in the fewest words. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t bet,&rdquo; was all
      he said. He showed no resentment at Sharon&rsquo;s familiarity, and he appeared
      to find no amusement in Sharon&rsquo;s extraordinary talk. The old vagabond
      seemed actually to produce a serious impression on him! When Mr. Troy set
      the example of rising to go, he still kept his seat, and looked at the
      lawyer as if he regretted leaving the atmosphere of tobacco smoke reeking
      in the dirty room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything to say before we go?&rdquo; Mr. Troy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moody rose slowly and looked at Old Sharon. &ldquo;Not just now, sir,&rdquo; he
      replied, looking away again, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sharon interpreted Moody&rsquo;s look and Moody&rsquo;s reply from his own
      peculiar point of view. He suddenly drew the steward away into a corner of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; he began, in a whisper. &ldquo;Upon your solemn word of honor, you know&mdash;are
      you as rich as the lawyer there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here! It&rsquo;s half price to a poor man. If you feel like coming back,
      on your own account&mdash;five pounds will do from <i>you</i>. There!
      there! Think of it!&mdash;think of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then!&rdquo; said Mr. Troy, waiting for his companion, with the door open
      in his hand. He looked back at Sharon when Moody joined him. The old
      vagabond was settled again in his armchair, with his dog in his lap, his
      pipe in his mouth, and his French novel in his hand; exhibiting exactly
      the picture of frowzy comfort which he had presented when his visitors
      first entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; said Mr. Troy, with haughty condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me!&rdquo; rejoined Old Sharon, absorbed in his novel. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      had your guinea&rsquo;s worth. Lord! what a lovely book this is! Don&rsquo;t interrupt
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impudent scoundrel!&rdquo; said Mr. Troy, when he and Moody were in the street
      again. &ldquo;What could my friend mean by recommending him? Fancy his expecting
      me to trust him with ten pounds! I consider even the guinea completely
      thrown away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begging your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said Moody, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite agree with you
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you don&rsquo;t mean to tell me you understand that oracular sentence of
      his&mdash;&lsquo;Suspect the very last person on whom suspicion could possibly
      fall.&rsquo; Rubbish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say I understand it, sir. I only say it has set me thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking of what? Do your suspicions point to the thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will please to excuse me, Mr. Troy, I should like to wait a while
      before I answer that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy suddenly stood still, and eyed his companion a little
      distrustfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to turn detective-policeman on your own account?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I won&rsquo;t turn to, and try, to help Miss Isabel in this
      matter,&rdquo; Moody answered, firmly. &ldquo;I have saved a few hundred pounds in
      Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s service, and I am ready to spend every farthing of it, if I
      can only discover the thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy walked on again. &ldquo;Miss Isabel seems to have a good friend in
      you,&rdquo; he said. He was (perhaps unconsciously) a little offended by the
      independent tone in which the steward spoke, after he had himself engaged
      to take the vindication of the girl&rsquo;s innocence into his own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Isabel has a devoted servant and slave in me!&rdquo; Moody answered, with
      passionate enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very creditable; I haven&rsquo;t a word to say against it,&rdquo; Mr. Troy rejoined.
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t forget that the young lady has other devoted friends besides
      you. I am her devoted friend, for instance&mdash;I have promised to serve
      her, and I mean to keep my word. You will excuse me for adding that my
      experience and discretion are quite as likely to be useful to her as your
      enthusiasm. I know the world well enough to be careful in trusting
      strangers. It will do you no harm, Mr. Moody, to follow my example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody accepted his reproof with becoming patience and resignation. &ldquo;If you
      have anything to propose, sir, that will be of service to Miss Isabel,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I shall be happy if I can assist you in the humblest capacity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if not?&rdquo; Mr. Troy inquired, conscious of having nothing to propose as
      he asked the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, sir, I must take my own course, and blame nobody but myself
      if it leads me astray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy said no more: he parted from Moody at the next turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuing the subject privately in his own mind, he decided on taking the
      earliest opportunity of visiting Isabel at her aunt&rsquo;s house, and on
      warning her, in her future intercourse with Moody, not to trust too much
      to the steward&rsquo;s discretion. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt,&rdquo; thought the lawyer, &ldquo;of
      what he means to do next. The infatuated fool is going back to Old
      Sharon!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      RETURNING to his office, Mr. Troy discovered, among the correspondence
      that was waiting for him, a letter from the very person whose welfare was
      still the uppermost subject in his mind. Isabel Miller wrote in these
      terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir&mdash;My aunt, Miss Pink, is very desirous of consulting you
      professionally at the earliest opportunity. Although South Morden is
      within little more than half an hour&rsquo;s railway ride from London, Miss Pink
      does not presume to ask you to visit her, being well aware of the value of
      your time. Will you, therefore, be so kind as to let me know when it will
      be convenient to you to receive my aunt at your office in London? Believe
      me, dear sir, respectfully yours, ISABEL MILLER. P.S.&mdash;I am further
      instructed to say that the regrettable event at Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house is
      the proposed subject of the consultation. The Lawn, South Morden.
      Thursday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy smiled as he read the letter. &ldquo;Too formal for a young girl!&rdquo; he
      said to himself. &ldquo;Every word of it has been dictated by Miss Pink.&rdquo; He was
      not long in deciding what course he should take. There was a pressing
      necessity for cautioning Isabel, and here was his opportunity. He sent for
      his head clerk, and looked at his list of engagements for the day. There
      was nothing set down in the book which the clerk was not quite as well
      able to do as the master. Mr. Troy consulted his railway-guide, ordered
      his cab, and caught the next train to South Morden.
    </p>
    <p>
      South Morden was then (and remains to this day) one of those primitive
      agricultural villages, passed over by the march of modern progress, which
      are still to be found in the near neighborhood of London. Only the slow
      trains stopped at the station and there was so little to do that the
      station-master and his porter grew flowers on the embankment, and trained
      creepers over the waiting-room window. Turning your back on the railway,
      and walking along the one street of South Morden, you found yourself in
      the old England of two centuries since. Gabled cottages, with fast-closed
      windows; pigs and poultry in quiet possession of the road; the venerable
      church surrounded by its shady burial-ground; the grocer&rsquo;s shop which sold
      everything, and the butcher&rsquo;s shop which sold nothing; the scarce
      inhabitants who liked a good look at a stranger, and the unwashed children
      who were pictures of dirty health; the clash of the iron-chained bucket in
      the public well, and the thump of the falling nine-pins in the
      skittle-ground behind the public-house; the horse-pond on the one bit of
      open ground, and the old elm-tree with the wooden seat round it on the
      other&mdash;these were some of the objects that you saw, and some of the
      noises that you heard in South Morden, as you passed from one end of the
      village to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half a mile beyond the last of the old cottages, modern England met
      you again under the form of a row of little villas, set up by an
      adventurous London builder who had bought the land a bargain. Each villa
      stood in its own little garden, and looked across a stony road at the
      meadow lands and softly-rising wooded hills beyond. Each villa faced you
      in the sunshine with the horrid glare of new red brick, and forced its
      nonsensical name on your attention, traced in bright paint on the posts of
      its entrance gate. Consulting the posts as he advanced, Mr. Troy arrived
      in due course of time at the villa called The Lawn, which derived its name
      apparently from a circular patch of grass in front of the house. The gate
      resisting his efforts to open it, he rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admitted by a trim, clean, shy little maid-servant, Mr. Troy looked about
      him in amazement. Turn which way he might, he found himself silently
      confronted by posted and painted instructions to visitors, which forbade
      him to do this, and commanded him to do that, at every step of his
      progress from the gate to the house. On the side of the lawn a label
      informed him that he was not to walk on the grass. On the other side a
      painted hand pointed along a boundary-wall to an inscription which warned
      him to go that way if he had business in the kitchen. On the gravel walk
      at the foot of the housesteps words, neatly traced in little white shells,
      reminded him not to &ldquo;forget the scraper&rdquo;. On the doorstep he was informed,
      in letters of lead, that he was &ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; On the mat in the passage
      bristly black words burst on his attention, commanding him to &ldquo;wipe his
      shoes.&rdquo; Even the hat-stand in the hall was not allowed to speak for
      itself; it had &ldquo;Hats and Cloaks&rdquo; inscribed on it, and it issued its
      directions imperatively in the matter of your wet umbrella&mdash;&ldquo;Put it
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giving the trim little servant his card, Mr. Troy was introduced to a
      reception-room on the lower floor. Before he had time to look round him
      the door was opened again from without, and Isabel stole into the room on
      tiptoe. She looked worn and anxious. When she shook hands with the old
      lawyer the charming smile that he remembered so well was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say you have seen me,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I am not to come into the
      room till my aunt sends for me. Tell me two things before I run away
      again. How is Lady Lydiard? And have you discovered the thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Lydiard was well when I last saw her; and we have not yet succeeded
      in discovering the thief.&rdquo; Having answered the questions in those terms,
      Mr. Troy decided on cautioning Isabel on the subject of the steward while
      he had the chance. &ldquo;One question on my side,&rdquo; he said, holding her back
      from the door by the arm. &ldquo;Do you expect Moody to visit you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am <i>sure</i> he will visit me,&rdquo; Isabel answered warmly. &ldquo;He has
      promised to come here at my request. I never knew what a kind heart Robert
      Moody had till this misfortune fell on me. My aunt, who is not easily
      taken with strangers, respects and admires him. I can&rsquo;t tell you how good
      he was to me on the journey here&mdash;and how kindly, how nobly, he spoke
      to me when we parted.&rdquo; She paused, and turned her head away. The tears
      were rising in her eyes. &ldquo;In my situation,&rdquo; she said faintly, &ldquo;kindness is
      very keenly felt. Don&rsquo;t notice me, Mr. Troy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer waited a moment to let her recover herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree entirely, my dear, in your opinion of Moody,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At the
      same time, I think it right to warn you that his zeal in your service may
      possibly outrun his discretion. He may feel too confidently about
      penetrating the mystery of the missing money; and, unless you are on your
      guard, he may raise false hopes in you when you next see him. Listen to
      any advice that he may give you, by all means. But, before you decide on
      being guided by his opinion, consult my older experience, and hear what I
      have to say on the subject. Don&rsquo;t suppose that I am attempting to make you
      distrust this good friend,&rdquo; he added, noticing the look of uneasy surprise
      which Isabel fixed on him. &ldquo;No such idea is in my mind. I only warn you
      that Moody&rsquo;s eagerness to be of service to you may mislead him. You
      understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Isabel coldly; &ldquo;I understand you. Please let me go
      now. My aunt will be down directly; and she must not find me here.&rdquo; She
      curtseyed with distant respect, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for trying to put two ideas together into a girl&rsquo;s mind!&rdquo; thought
      Mr. Troy, when he was alone again. &ldquo;The little fool evidently thinks I am
      jealous of Moody&rsquo;s place in her estimation. Well! I have done my duty&mdash;and
      I can do no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked round the room. Not a chair was out of its place, not a speck of
      dust was to be seen. The brightly-perfect polish of the table made your
      eyes ache; the ornaments on it looked as if they had never been touched by
      mortal hand; the piano was an object for distant admiration, not an
      instrument to be played on; the carpet made Mr. Troy look nervously at the
      soles of his shoes; and the sofa (protected by layers of white
      crochet-work) said as plainly as if in words, &ldquo;Sit on me if you dare!&rdquo; Mr.
      Troy retreated to a bookcase at the further end of the room. The books
      fitted the shelves to such absolute perfection that he had some difficulty
      in taking one of them out. When he had succeeded, he found himself in
      possession of a volume of the History of England. On the fly-leaf he
      encountered another written warning:&mdash;&ldquo;This book belongs to Miss
      Pink&rsquo;s Academy for Young Ladies, and is not to be removed from the
      library.&rdquo; The date, which was added, referred to a period of ten years
      since. Miss Pink now stood revealed as a retired schoolmistress, and Mr.
      Troy began to understand some of the characteristic peculiarities of that
      lady&rsquo;s establishment which had puzzled him up to the present time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just succeeded in putting the book back again when the door opened
      once more, and Isabel&rsquo;s aunt entered the room.

    <p>
      If Miss Pink could, by any possible conjuncture of circumstances, have
      disappeared mysteriously from her house and her friends, the police would
      have found the greatest difficulty in composing the necessary description
      of the missing lady. The acutest observer could have discovered nothing
      that was noticeable or characteristic in her personal appearance. The pen
      of the present writer portrays her in despair by a series of negatives.
      She was not young, she was not old; she was neither tall nor short, nor
      stout nor thin; nobody could call her features attractive, and nobody
      could call them ugly; there was nothing in her voice, her expression, her
      manner, or her dress that differed in any appreciable degree from the
      voice, expression, manner, and dress of five hundred thousand other single
      ladies of her age and position in the world. If you had asked her to
      describe herself, she would have answered, &ldquo;I am a gentlewoman&rdquo;; and if
      you had further inquired which of her numerous accomplishments took
      highest rank in her own esteem, she would have replied, &ldquo;My powers of
      conversation.&rdquo; For the rest, she was Miss Pink, of South Morden; and, when
      that has been said, all has been said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray be seated, sir. We have had a beautiful day, after the
      long-continued wet weather. I am told that the season is very unfavorable
      for wall-fruit. May I offer you some refreshment after your journey?&rdquo; In
      these terms and in the smoothest of voices, Miss Pink opened the
      interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy made a polite reply, and added a few strictly conventional
      remarks on the beauty of the neighborhood. Not even a lawyer could sit in
      Miss Pink&rsquo;s presence, and hear Miss Pink&rsquo;s conversation, without feeling
      himself called upon (in the nursery phrase) to &ldquo;be on his best behavior&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is extremely kind of you, Mr. Troy, to favor me with this visit,&rdquo; Miss
      Pink resumed. &ldquo;I am well aware that the time of professional gentlemen is
      of especial value to them; and I will therefore ask you to excuse me if I
      proceed abruptly to the subject on which I desire to consult your
      experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the lady modestly smoothed out her dress over her knees, and the
      lawyer made a bow. Miss Pink&rsquo;s highly-trained conversation had perhaps one
      fault&mdash;it was not, strictly speaking, conversation at all. In its
      effect on her hearers it rather resembled the contents of a fluently
      conventional letter, read aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The circumstances under which my niece Isabel has left Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s
      house,&rdquo; Miss Pink proceeded, &ldquo;are so indescribably painful&mdash;I will go
      further, I will say so deeply humiliating&mdash;that I have forbidden her
      to refer to them again in my presence, or to mention them in the future to
      any living creature besides myself. You are acquainted with those
      circumstances, Mr. Troy; and you will understand my indignation when I
      first learnt that my sister&rsquo;s child had been suspected of theft. I have
      not the honor of being acquainted with Lady Lydiard. She is not a
      Countess, I believe? Just so! Her husband was only a Baron. I am not
      acquainted with Lady Lydiard; and I will not trust myself to say what I
      think of her conduct to my niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, madam,&rdquo; Mr. Troy interposed. &ldquo;Before you say any more about
      Lady Lydiard, I really must beg leave to observe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon <i>me</i>,&rdquo; Miss Pink rejoined. &ldquo;I never form a hasty judgment.
      Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s conduct is beyond the reach of any defense, no matter how
      ingenious it may be. You may not be aware, sir, that in receiving my niece
      under her roof her Ladyship was receiving a gentlewoman by birth as well
      as by education. My late lamented sister was the daughter of a clergyman
      of the Church of England. I need hardly remind you that, as such, she was
      a born lady. Under favoring circumstances, Isabel&rsquo;s maternal grandfather
      might have been Archbishop of Canterbury, and have taken precedence of the
      whole House of Peers, the Princes of the blood Royal alone excepted. I am
      not prepared to say that my niece is equally well connected on her
      father&rsquo;s side. My sister surprised&mdash;I will not add shocked&mdash;us
      when she married a chemist. At the same time, a chemist is not a
      tradesman. He is a gentleman at one end of the profession of Medicine, and
      a titled physician is a gentleman at the other end. That is all. In
      inviting Isabel to reside with her, Lady Lydiard, I repeat, was bound to
      remember that she was associating herself with a young gentlewoman. She
      has <i>not</i> remembered this, which is one insult; and she has suspected
      my niece of theft, which is another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink paused to take breath. Mr. Troy made a second attempt to get a
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kindly permit me, madam, to say a few words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Miss Pink, asserting the most immovable obstinacy under the
      blandest politeness of manner. &ldquo;Your time, Mr. Troy, is really too
      valuable! Not even your trained intellect can excuse conduct which is
      manifestly <i>in</i>excusable on the face of it. Now you know my opinion
      of Lady Lydiard, you will not be surprised to hear that I decline to trust
      her Ladyship. She may, or she may not, cause the necessary inquiries to be
      made for the vindication of my niece&rsquo;s character. In a matter so serious
      as this&mdash;I may say, in a duty which I owe to the memories of my
      sister and my parents&mdash;I will not leave the responsibility to Lady
      Lydiard. I will take it on myself. Let me add that I am able to pay the
      necessary expenses. The earlier years of my life, Mr. Troy, have been
      passed in the tuition of young ladies. I have been happy in meriting the
      confidence of parents; and I have been strict in observing the golden
      rules of economy. On my retirement, I have been able to invest a modest, a
      very modest, little fortune in the Funds. A portion of it is at the
      service of my niece for the recovery of her good name; and I desire to
      place the necessary investigation confidentially in your hands. You are
      acquainted with the case, and the case naturally goes to you. I could not
      prevail on myself&mdash;I really could not prevail on myself&mdash;to
      mention it to a stranger. That is the business on which I wished to
      consult you. Please say nothing more about Lady Lydiard&mdash;the subject
      is inexpressibly disagreeable to me. I will only trespass on your kindness
      to tell me if I have succeeded in making myself understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink leaned back in her chair, at the exact angle permitted by the
      laws of propriety; rested her left elbow on the palm of her right hand,
      and lightly supported her cheek with her forefinger and thumb. In this
      position she waited Mr. Troy&rsquo;s answer&mdash;the living picture of human
      obstinacy in its most respectable form.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Troy had not been a lawyer&mdash;in other words, if he had not been
      professionally capable of persisting in his own course, in the face of
      every conceivable difficulty and discouragement&mdash;Miss Pink might have
      remained in undisturbed possession of her own opinions. As it was, Mr.
      Troy had got his hearing at last; and no matter how obstinately she might
      close her eyes to it, Miss Pink was now destined to have the other side of
      the case presented to her view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sincerely obliged to you, madam, for the expression of your
      confidence in me,&rdquo; Mr. Troy began; &ldquo;at the same time, I must beg you to
      excuse me if I decline to accept your proposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink had not expected to receive such an answer as this. The lawyer&rsquo;s
      brief refusal surprised and annoyed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you decline to assist me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered Mr. Troy, &ldquo;my services are already engaged, in Miss
      Isabel&rsquo;s interest, by a client whom I have served for more than twenty
      years. My client is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink anticipated the coming disclosure. &ldquo;You need not trouble
      yourself, sir, to mention your client&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My client,&rdquo; persisted Mr. Troy, &ldquo;loves Miss Isabel dearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a matter of opinion,&rdquo; Miss Pink interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And believes in Miss Isabel&rsquo;s innocence,&rdquo; proceeded the irrepressible
      lawyer, &ldquo;as firmly as you believe in it yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink (being human) had a temper; and Mr. Troy had found his way to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Lady Lydiard believes in my niece&rsquo;s innocence,&rdquo; said Miss Pink,
      suddenly sitting bolt upright in her chair, &ldquo;why has my niece been
      compelled, in justice to herself, to leave Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will admit, madam,&rdquo; Mr. Troy answered cautiously, &ldquo;that we are all of
      us liable, in this wicked world, to be the victims of appearances. Your
      niece is a victim&mdash;an innocent victim. She wisely withdraws from Lady
      Lydiard&rsquo;s house until appearances are proved to be false and her position
      is cleared up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink had her reply ready. &ldquo;That is simply acknowledging, in other
      words, that my niece is suspected. I am only a woman, Mr. Troy&mdash;but
      it is not quite so easy to mislead me as you seem to suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy&rsquo;s temper was admirably trained. But it began to acknowledge that
      Miss Pink&rsquo;s powers of irritation could sting to some purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No intention of misleading you, madam, has ever crossed my mind,&rdquo; he
      rejoined warmly. &ldquo;As for your niece, I can tell you this. In all my
      experience of Lady Lydiard, I never saw her so distressed as she was when
      Miss Isabel left the house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Miss Pink, with an incredulous smile. &ldquo;In my rank of life,
      when we feel distressed about a person, we do our best to comfort that
      person by a kind letter or an early visit. But then I am not a lady of
      title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Lydiard engaged herself to call on Miss Isabel in my hearing,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Troy. &ldquo;Lady Lydiard is the most generous woman living!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Lydiard is here!&rdquo; cried a joyful voice on the other side of the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, Isabel burst into the room in a state of excitement
      which actually ignored the formidable presence of Miss Pink. &ldquo;I beg your
      pardon, aunt! I was upstairs at the window, and I saw the carriage stop at
      the gate. And Tommie has come, too! The darling saw me at the window!&rdquo;
       cried the poor girl, her eyes sparkling with delight as a perfect
      explosion of barking made itself heard over the tramp of horses&rsquo; feet and
      the crash of carriage wheels outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink rose slowly, with a dignity that looked capable of adequately
      receiving&mdash;not one noble lady only, but the whole peerage of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Control yourself, dear Isabel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No well-bred young lady
      permits herself to become unduly excited. Stand by my side&mdash;a little
      behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel obeyed. Mr. Troy kept his place, and privately enjoyed his triumph
      over Miss Pink. If Lady Lydiard had been actually in league with him, she
      could not have chosen a more opportune time for her visit. A momentary
      interval passed. The carriage drew up at the door; the horses trampled on
      the gravel; the bell rung madly; the uproar of Tommie, released from the
      carriage and clamoring to be let in, redoubled its fury. Never before had
      such an unruly burst of noises invaded the tranquility of Miss Pink&rsquo;s
      villa!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE trim little maid-servant ran upstairs from her modest little kitchen,
      trembling at the terrible prospect of having to open the door. Miss Pink,
      deafened by the barking, had just time to say, &ldquo;What a very ill-behaved
      dog!&rdquo; when a sound of small objects overthrown in the hall, and a
      scurrying of furious claws across the oil-cloth, announced that Tommie had
      invaded the house. As the servant appeared, introducing Lady Lydiard, the
      dog ran in. He made one frantic leap at Isabel, which would certainly have
      knocked her down but for the chair that happened to be standing behind
      her. Received on her lap, the faithful creature half smothered her with
      his caresses. He barked, he shrieked, in his joy at seeing her again. He
      jumped off her lap and tore round and round the room at the top of his
      speed; and every time he passed Miss Pink he showed the whole range of his
      teeth and snarled ferociously at her ankles. Having at last exhausted his
      superfluous energy, he leaped back again on Isabel&rsquo;s lap, with his tongue
      quivering in his open mouth&mdash;his tail wagging softly, and his eye on
      Miss Pink, inquiring how she liked a dog in her drawing-room!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope my dog has not disturbed you, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said Lady Lydiard, advancing
      from the mat at the doorway, on which she had patiently waited until the
      raptures of Tommie subsided into repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink, trembling between terror and indignation, acknowledged Lady
      Lydiard&rsquo;s polite inquiry by a ceremonious bow, and an answer which
      administered by implication a dignified reproof. &ldquo;Your Ladyship&rsquo;s dog does
      not appear to be a very well-trained animal,&rdquo; the ex-schoolmistress
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well trained?&rdquo; Lady Lydiard repeated, as if the expression was perfectly
      unintelligible to her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you have had much experience of
      dogs, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; She turned to Isabel, and embraced her tenderly. &ldquo;Give me a
      kiss, my dear&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know how wretched I have been since you left
      me.&rdquo; She looked back again at Miss Pink. &ldquo;You are not, perhaps, aware,
      ma&rsquo;am, that my dog is devotedly attached to your niece. A dog&rsquo;s love has
      been considered by many great men (whose names at the moment escape me) as
      the most touching and disinterested of all earthly affections.&rdquo; She looked
      the other way, and discovered the lawyer. &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Troy? It&rsquo;s a
      pleasant surprise to find you here The house was so dull without Isabel
      that I really couldn&rsquo;t put off seeing her any longer. When you are more
      used to Tommie, Miss Pink, you will understand and admire him. <i>You</i>
      understand and admire him, Isabel&mdash;don&rsquo;t you? My child! you are not
      looking well. I shall take you back with me, when the horses have had
      their rest. We shall never be happy away from each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having expressed her sentiments, distributed her greetings, and defended
      her dog&mdash;all, as it were, in one breath&mdash;Lady Lydiard sat down
      by Isabel&rsquo;s side, and opened a large green fan that hung at her girdle.
      &ldquo;You have no idea, Miss Pink, how fat people suffer in hot weather,&rdquo; said
      the old lady, using her fan vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink&rsquo;s eyes dropped modestly to the ground&mdash;&ldquo;fat&rdquo; was such a
      coarse word to use, if a lady <i>must</i> speak of her own superfluous
      flesh! &ldquo;May I offer some refreshment?&rdquo; Miss Pink asked, mincingly. &ldquo;A cup
      of tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A glass of water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard declined this last hospitable proposal with an exclamation of
      disgust. &ldquo;Have you got any beer?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your Ladyship&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; said Miss Pink, doubting the evidence of
      her own ears. &ldquo;Did you say&mdash;beer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard gesticulated vehemently with her fan. &ldquo;Yes, to be sure! Beer!
      beer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink rose, with a countenance expressive of genteel disgust, and rang
      the bell. &ldquo;I think you have beer downstairs, Susan?&rdquo; she said, when the
      maid appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A glass of beer for Lady Lydiard,&rdquo; said Miss Pink&mdash;under protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring it in a jug,&rdquo; shouted her Ladyship, as the maid left the room. &ldquo;I
      like to froth it up for myself,&rdquo; she continued, addressing Miss Pink.
      &ldquo;Isabel sometimes does it for me, when she is at home&mdash;don&rsquo;t you, my
      dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink had been waiting her opportunity to assert her own claim to the
      possession of her own niece, from the time when Lady Lydiard had coolly
      declared her intention of taking Isabel back with her. The opportunity now
      presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Ladyship will pardon me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I remark that my niece&rsquo;s
      home is under my humble roof. I am properly sensible, I hope, of your
      kindness to Isabel, but while she remains the object of a disgraceful
      suspicion she remains with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard closed her fan with an angry snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are completely mistaken, Miss Pink. You may not mean it&mdash;but you
      speak most unjustly if you say that your niece is an object of suspicion
      to me, or to anybody in my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy, quietly listening up to this point now interposed to stop the
      discussion before it could degenerate into a personal quarrel. His keen
      observation, aided by his accurate knowledge of his client&rsquo;s character,
      had plainly revealed to him what was passing in Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s mind. She
      had entered the house, feeling (perhaps unconsciously) a jealousy of Miss
      Pink, as her predecessor in Isabel&rsquo;s affections, and as the natural
      protectress of the girl under existing circumstances. Miss Pink&rsquo;s
      reception of her dog had additionally irritated the old lady. She had
      taken a malicious pleasure in shocking the schoolmistress&rsquo;s sense of
      propriety&mdash;and she was now only too ready to proceed to further
      extremities on the delicate question of Isabel&rsquo;s justification for leaving
      her house. For Isabel&rsquo;s own sake, therefore&mdash;to say nothing of other
      reasons&mdash;it was urgently desirable to keep the peace between the two
      ladies. With this excellent object in view, Mr. Troy seized his
      opportunity of striking into the conversation for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Lady Lydiard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are speaking of a subject which
      has been already sufficiently discussed between Miss Pink and myself. I
      think we shall do better not to dwell uselessly on past events, but to
      direct our attention to the future. We are all equally satisfied of the
      complete rectitude of Miss Isabel&rsquo;s conduct, and we are all equally
      interested in the vindication of her good name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether these temperate words would of themselves have exercised the
      pacifying influence at which Mr. Troy aimed may be doubtful. But, as he
      ceased speaking, a powerful auxiliary appeared in the shape of the beer.
      Lady Lydiard seized on the jug, and filled the tumbler for herself with an
      unsteady hand. Miss Pink, trembling for the integrity of her carpet, and
      scandalized at seeing a peeress drinking beer like a washer-woman, forgot
      the sharp answer that was just rising to her lips when the lawyer
      interfered. &ldquo;Small!&rdquo; said Lady Lydiard, setting down the empty tumbler,
      and referring to the quality of the beer. &ldquo;But very pleasant and
      refreshing. What&rsquo;s the servant&rsquo;s name? Susan? Well, Susan, I was dying of
      thirst and you have saved my life. You can leave the jug&mdash;I dare say
      I shall empty it before I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy, watching Miss Pink&rsquo;s face, saw that it was time to change the
      subject again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice the old village, Lady Lydiard, on your way here?&rdquo; he
      asked. &ldquo;The artists consider it one of the most picturesque places in
      England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed that it was a very dirty village,&rdquo; Lady Lydiard answered, still
      bent on making herself disagreeable to Miss Pink. &ldquo;The artists may say
      what they please; I see nothing to admire in rotten cottages, and bad
      drainage, and ignorant people. I suppose the neighborhood has its
      advantages. It looks dull enough, to my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel had hitherto modestly restricted her exertions to keeping Tommie
      quiet on her lap. Like Mr. Troy, she occasionally looked at her aunt&mdash;and
      she now made a timid attempt to defend the neighborhood as a duty that she
      owed to Miss Pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my Lady! don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a dull neighborhood,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;There are
      such pretty walks all round us. And, when you get to the hills, the view
      is beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s answer to this was a little masterpiece of good-humored
      contempt. She patted Isabel&rsquo;s cheek, and said, &ldquo;Pooh! Pooh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Ladyship does not admire the beauties of Nature,&rdquo; Miss Pink
      remarked, with a compassionate smile. &ldquo;As we get older, no doubt our sight
      begins to fail&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we leave off canting about the beauties of Nature,&rdquo; added Lady
      Lydiard. &ldquo;I hate the country. Give me London, and the pleasures of
      society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come! Do the country justice, Lady Lydiard!&rdquo; put in peace-making
      Mr. Troy. &ldquo;There is plenty of society to be found out of London&mdash;as
      good society as the world can show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sort of society,&rdquo; added Miss Pink, &ldquo;which is to be found, for
      example, in this neighborhood. Her Ladyship is evidently not aware that
      persons of distinction surround us, whichever way we turn. I may instance
      among others, the Honorable Mr. Hardyman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard, in the act of pouring out a second glassful of beer,
      suddenly set down the jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that you&rsquo;re talking of, Miss Pink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am talking of our neighbor, Lady Lydiard&mdash;the Honorable Mr.
      Hardyman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean Alfred Hardyman&mdash;the man who breeds the horses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The distinguished gentleman who owns the famous stud-farm,&rdquo; said Miss
      Pink, correcting the bluntly-direct form in which Lady Lydiard had put her
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he in the habit of visiting here?&rdquo; the old lady inquired, with a
      sudden appearance of anxiety. &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the honor of being introduced to Mr. Hardyman at our last flower
      show,&rdquo; Miss Pink replied. &ldquo;He has not yet favored me with a visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s anxiety appeared to be to some extent relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that Hardyman&rsquo;s farm was in this county,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I had no
      notion that it was in the neighborhood of South Morden. How far away is he&mdash;ten
      or a dozen miles, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than three miles,&rdquo; answered Miss Pink. &ldquo;We consider him quite a
      near neighbor of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renewed anxiety showed itself in Lady Lydiard. She looked round sharply at
      Isabel. The girl&rsquo;s head was bent so low over the rough head of the dog
      that her face was almost entirely concealed from view. So far as
      appearances went, she seemed to be entirely absorbed in fondling Tommie.
      Lady Lydiard roused her with a tap of the green fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take Tommie out, Isabel, for a run in the garden,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t
      sit still much longer&mdash;and he may annoy Miss Pink. Mr. Troy, will you
      kindly help Isabel to keep my ill-trained dog in order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy got on his feet, and, not very willingly, followed Isabel out of
      the room. &ldquo;They will quarrel now, to a dead certainty!&rdquo; he thought to
      himself, as he closed the door. &ldquo;Have you any idea of what this means?&rdquo; he
      said to his companion, as he joined her in the hall. &ldquo;What has Mr.
      Hardyman done to excite all this interest in him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel&rsquo;s guilty color rose. She knew perfectly well that Hardyman&rsquo;s
      unconcealed admiration of her was the guiding motive of Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s
      inquiries. If she had told the truth, Mr. Troy would have unquestionably
      returned to the drawing-room, with or without an acceptable excuse for
      intruding himself. But Isabel was a woman; and her answer, it is needless
      to say, was &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, the interview between the two ladies began in a manner
      which would have astonished Mr. Troy&mdash;they were both silent. For once
      in her life Lady Lydiard was considering what she should say, before she
      said it. Miss Pink, on her side, naturally waited to hear what object her
      Ladyship had in view&mdash;waited, until her small reserve of patience
      gave way. Urged by irresistible curiosity, she spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything to say to me in private?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard had not got to the end of her reflections. She said &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;&mdash;and
      she said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it anything relating to my niece?&rdquo; persisted Miss Pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still immersed in her reflections, Lady Lydiard suddenly rose to the
      surface, and spoke her mind, as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About your niece, ma&rsquo;am. The other day Mr. Hardyman called at my house,
      and saw Isabel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Pink, politely attentive, but not in the least
      interested, so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all ma&rsquo;am. Mr. Hardyman admires Isabel; he owned it to me
      himself in so many words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink listened, with a courteous inclination of her head. She looked
      mildly gratified, nothing more. Lady Lydiard proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and I think differently on many matters,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But we are both
      agreed, I am sure, in feeling the sincerest interest in Isabel&rsquo;s welfare.
      I beg to suggest to you, Miss Pink, that Mr. Hardyman, as a near neighbor
      of yours, is a very undesirable neighbor while Isabel remains in your
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying those words, under a strong conviction of the serious importance of
      the subject, Lady Lydiard insensibly recovered the manner and resumed the
      language which befitted a lady of her rank. Miss Pink, noticing the
      change, set it down to an expression of pride on the part of her visitor
      which, in referring to Isabel, assailed indirectly the social position of
      Isabel&rsquo;s aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fail entirely to understand what your Ladyship means,&rdquo; she said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard, on her side, looked in undisguised amazement at Miss Pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you already that Mr. Hardyman admires your niece?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Miss Pink. &ldquo;Isabel inherits her lamented mother&rsquo;s
      personal advantages. If Mr. Hardyman admires her, Mr. Hardyman shows his
      good taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s eyes opened wider and wider in wonder. &ldquo;My good lady!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, &ldquo;is it possible you don&rsquo;t know that when a man admires a women
      he doesn&rsquo;t stop there? He falls in love with her (as the saying is) next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have heard,&rdquo; said Miss Pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have <i>heard?</i>&rdquo; repeated Lady Lydiard. &ldquo;If Mr. Hardyman finds
      his way to Isabel I can tell you what you will <i>see</i>. Catch the two
      together, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;and you will see Mr. Hardyman making love to your
      niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under due restrictions, Lady Lydiard, and with my permission first
      obtained, of course, I see no objection to Mr. Hardyman paying his
      addresses to Isabel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman is mad!&rdquo; cried Lady Lydiard. &ldquo;Do you actually suppose, Miss
      Pink, that Alfred Hardyman could, by any earthly possibility, marry your
      niece!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not even Miss Pink&rsquo;s politeness could submit to such a question as this.
      She rose indignantly from her chair. &ldquo;As you aware, Lady Lydiard, that the
      doubt you have just expressed is an insult to my niece, and a insult to
      Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are <i>you</i> aware of who Mr. Hardyman really is?&rdquo; retorted her
      Ladyship. &ldquo;Or do you judge of his position by the vocation in life which
      he has perversely chosen to adopt? I can tell you, if you do, that Alfred
      Hardyman is the younger son of one of the oldest barons in the English
      Peerage, and that his mother is related by marriage to the Royal family of
      Wurtemberg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink received the full shock of this information without receding
      from her position by a hair-breadth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An English gentlewoman offers a fit alliance to any man living who seeks
      her hand in marriage,&rdquo; said Miss Pink. &ldquo;Isabel&rsquo;s mother (you may not be
      aware of it) was the daughter of an English clergyman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Isabel&rsquo;s father was a chemist in a country town,&rdquo; added Lady Lydiard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isabel&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; rejoined Miss Pink, &ldquo;was attached in a most responsible
      capacity to the useful and honorable profession of Medicine. Isabel is, in
      the strictest sense of the word, a young gentlewoman. If you contradict
      that for a single instant, Lady Lydiard, you will oblige me to leave the
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those last words produced a result which Miss Pink had not anticipated&mdash;they
      roused Lady Lydiard to assert herself. As usual in such cases, she rose
      superior to her own eccentricity. Confronting Miss Pink, she now spoke and
      looked with the gracious courtesy and the unpresuming self-confidence of
      the order to which she belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Isabel&rsquo;s own sake, and for the quieting of my conscience,&rdquo; she
      answered, &ldquo;I will say one word more, Miss Pink, before I relieve you of my
      presence. Considering my age and my opportunities, I may claim to know
      quite as much as you do of the laws and customs which regulate society in
      our time. Without contesting your niece&rsquo;s social position&mdash;and
      without the slightest intention of insulting you&mdash;I repeat that the
      rank which Mr. Hardyman inherits makes it simply impossible for him even
      to think of marrying Isabel. You will do well not to give him any
      opportunities of meeting with her alone. And you will do better still
      (seeing that he is so near a neighbor of yours) if you permit Isabel to
      return to my protection, for a time at least. I will wait to hear from you
      when you have thought the matter over at your leisure. In the mean time,
      if I have inadvertently offended you, I ask your pardon&mdash;and I wish
      you good-evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bowed, and walked to the door. Miss Pink, as resolute as ever in
      maintaining her pretensions, made an effort to match the great lady on her
      own ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you go, Lady Lydiard, I beg to apologize if I have spoken too
      warmly on my side,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Permit me to send for your carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Miss Pink. My carriage is only at the village inn. I shall
      enjoy a little walk in the cool evening air. Mr. Troy, I have no doubt,
      will give me his arm.&rdquo; She bowed once more, and quietly left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the little back garden of the villa, through an open door at the
      further end of the hall, Lady Lydiard found Tommie rolling luxuriously on
      Miss Pink&rsquo;s flower-beds, and Isabel and Mr. Troy in close consultation on
      the gravel walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke to the lawyer first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are baiting the horses at the inn,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want your arm, Mr.
      Troy, as far as the village&mdash;and, in return, I will take you back to
      London with me. I have to ask your advice about one or two little matters,
      and this is a good opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the greatest pleasure, Lady Lydiard. I suppose I must say good-by to
      Miss Pink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word of advice to you, Mr. Troy. Take care how you ruffle Miss Pink&rsquo;s
      sense of her own importance. Another word for your private ear. Miss Pink
      is a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the lawyer&rsquo;s withdrawal, Lady Lydiard put her arm fondly round Isabel&rsquo;s
      waist. &ldquo;What were you and Mr. Troy so busy in talking about?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were talking, my Lady, about tracing the person who stole the money,&rdquo;
       Isabel answered, rather sadly. &ldquo;It seems a far more difficult matter than
      I supposed it to be. I try not to lose patience and hope&mdash;but it is a
      little hard to feel that appearances are against me, and to wait day after
      day in vain for the discovery that is to set me right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a dear good child,&rdquo; said Lady Lydiard; &ldquo;and you are more precious
      to me than ever. Don&rsquo;t despair, Isabel. With Mr. Troy&rsquo;s means of
      inquiring, and with my means of paying, the discovery of the thief cannot
      be much longer delayed. If you don&rsquo;t return to me soon, I shall come back
      and see you again. Your aunt hates the sight of me&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t care
      two straws for that,&rdquo; remarked Lady Lydiard, showing the undignified side
      of her character once more. &ldquo;Listen to me, Isabel! I have no wish to lower
      your aunt in your estimation, but I feel far more confidence in your good
      sense than in hers. Mr. Hardyman&rsquo;s business has taken him to France for
      the present. It is at least possible that you may meet with him on his
      return. If you do, keep him at a distance, my dear&mdash;politely, of
      course. There! there! you needn&rsquo;t turn red; I am not blaming you; I am
      only giving you a little good advice. In your position you cannot possibly
      be too careful. Here is Mr. Troy! You must come to the gate with us,
      Isabel, or we shall never get Tommie away from you; I am only his second
      favorite; you have the first place in his affections. God bless and
      prosper you, my child!&mdash;I wish to heaven you were going back to
      London with me! Well, Mr. Troy, how have you done with Miss Pink? Have you
      offended that terrible &lsquo;gentlewoman&rsquo; (hateful word!); or has it been all
      the other way, and has she given you a kiss at parting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy smiled mysteriously, and changed the subject. His brief parting
      interview with the lady of the house was not of a nature to be rashly
      related. Miss Pink had not only positively assured him that her visitor
      was the most ill-bred woman she had ever met with, but had further accused
      Lady Lydiard of shaking her confidence in the aristocracy of her native
      country. &ldquo;For the first time in my life,&rdquo; said Miss Pink, &ldquo;I feel that
      something is to be said for the Republican point of view; and I am not
      indisposed to admit that the constitution of the United States <i>has</i>
      its advantages!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE conference between Lady Lydiard and Mr. Troy, on the way back to
      London, led to some practical results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing from her legal adviser that the inquiry after the missing money
      was for a moment at a standstill, Lady Lydiard made one of those bold
      suggestions with which she was accustomed to startle her friends in cases
      of emergency. She had heard favorable reports of the extraordinary
      ingenuity of the French police; and she now proposed sending to Paris for
      assistance, after first consulting her nephew, Mr. Felix Sweetsir. &ldquo;Felix
      knows Paris as well as he knows London,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;He is an idle man,
      and it is quite likely that he will relieve us of all trouble by taking
      the matter into his own hands. In any case, he is sure to know who are the
      right people to address in our present necessity. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy, in reply, expressed his doubts as to the wisdom of employing
      foreigners in a delicate investigation which required an accurate
      knowledge of English customs and English character. Waiving this
      objection, he approved of the idea of consulting her Ladyship&rsquo;s nephew.
      &ldquo;Mr. Sweetsir is a man of the world,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In putting the case before
      him, we are sure to have it presented to us from a new point of view.&rdquo;
       Acting on this favorable expression of opinion, Lady Lydiard wrote to her
      nephew. On the day after the visit to Miss Pink, the proposed council of
      three was held at Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix, never punctual at keeping an appointment, was even later than usual
      on this occasion. He made his apologies with his hand pressed upon his
      forehead, and his voice expressive of the languor and discouragement of a
      suffering man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beastly English climate is telling on my nerves,&rdquo; said Mr. Sweetsir&mdash;&ldquo;the
      horrid weight of the atmosphere, after the exhilarating air of Paris; the
      intolerable dirt and dullness of London, you know. I was in bed, my dear
      aunt, when I received your letter. You may imagine the completely
      demoralised state I was in, when I tell you of the effect which the news
      of the robbery produced on me. I fell back on my pillow, as if I had been
      shot. Your Ladyship should really be a little more careful in
      communicating these disagreeable surprises to a sensitively-organised man.
      Never mind&mdash;my valet is a perfect treasure; he brought me some drops
      of ether on a lump of sugar. I said, &lsquo;Alfred&rsquo; (his name is Alfred), &lsquo;put
      me into my clothes!&rsquo; Alfred put me in. I assure you it reminded me of my
      young days, when I was put into my first pair of trousers. Has Alfred
      forgotten anything? Have I got my braces on? Have I come out in my
      shirt-sleeves? Well, dear aunt;&mdash;well, Mr. Troy!&mdash;what can I
      say? What can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard, entirely without sympathy for nervous suffering, nodded to
      the lawyer. &ldquo;You tell him,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I speak for her Ladyship,&rdquo; Mr. Troy began, &ldquo;when I say that we
      should like to hear, in the first place, how the whole case strikes you,
      Mr. Sweetsir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell it me all over again,&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patient Mr. Troy told it all over again&mdash;and waited for the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mr. Troy. &ldquo;Where does the suspicion of robbery rest in your
      opinion? You look at the theft of the bank-note with a fresh eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mentioned a clergyman just now,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;The man, you know, to
      whom the money was sent. What was his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Reverend Samuel Bradstock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me to name the person whom I suspect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you please,&rdquo; said Mr. Troy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect the Reverend Samuel Bradstock,&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have come here to make stupid jokes,&rdquo; interposed Lady Lydiard,
      &ldquo;you had better go back to your bed again. We want a serious opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>have</i> a serious opinion,&rdquo; Felix coolly rejoined. &ldquo;I never was
      more in earnest in my life. Your Ladyship is not aware of the first
      principle to be adopted in cases of suspicion. One proceeds on what I will
      call the exhaustive system of reasoning. Thus: Does suspicion point to the
      honest servants downstairs? No. To your Ladyship&rsquo;s adopted daughter?
      Appearances are against the poor girl; but you know her better than to
      trust to appearances. Are you suspicious of Moody? No. Of Hardyman&mdash;who
      was in the house at the time? Ridiculous! But I was in the house at the
      time, too. Do you suspect Me? Just so! That idea is ridiculous, too. Now
      let us sum up. Servants, adopted daughter, Moody, Hardyman, Sweetsir&mdash;all
      beyond suspicion. Who is left? The Reverend Samuel Bradstock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This ingenious exposition of &ldquo;the exhaustive system of reasoning,&rdquo; failed
      to produce any effect on Lady Lydiard. &ldquo;You are wasting our time,&rdquo; she
      said sharply. &ldquo;You know as well as I do that you are talking nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;Taking the gentlemanly professions all round, I
      know of no men who are so eager to get money, and who have so few scruples
      about how they get it, as the parsons. Where is there a man in any other
      profession who perpetually worries you for money?&mdash;who holds the bag
      under your nose for money?&mdash;who sends his clerk round from door to
      door to beg a few shillings of you, and calls it an &lsquo;Easter offering&rsquo;? The
      parson does all this. Bradstock is a parson. I put it logically. Bowl me
      over, if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy attempted to &ldquo;bowl him over,&rdquo; nevertheless. Lady Lydiard wisely
      interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a man persists in talking nonsense,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;silence is the best
      answer; anything else only encourages him.&rdquo; She turned to Felix. &ldquo;I have a
      question to ask you,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You will either give me a serious
      reply, or wish me good-morning.&rdquo; With this brief preface, she made her
      inquiry as to the wisdom and possibility of engaging the services of the
      French police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix took exactly the view of the matter which had been already expressed
      by Mr. Troy. &ldquo;Superior in intelligence,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but not superior in
      courage, to the English police. Capable of performing wonders on their own
      ground and among their own people. But, my dear aunt, the two most
      dissimilar nations on the face of the earth are the English and the
      French. The French police may speak our language&mdash;but they are
      incapable of understanding our national character and our national
      manners. Set them to work on a private inquiry in the city of Pekin&mdash;and
      they would get on in time with the Chinese people. Set them to work in the
      city of London&mdash;and the English people would remain, from first to
      last, the same impenetrable mystery to them. In my belief the London
      Sunday would be enough of itself to drive them back to Paris in despair.
      No balls, no concerts, no theaters, not even a museum or a picture-gallery
      open; every shop shut up but the gin-shop; and nothing moving but the
      church bells and the men who sell the penny ices. Hundreds of Frenchmen
      come to see me on their first arrival in England. Every man of them rushes
      back to Paris on the second Saturday of his visit, rather than confront
      the horrors of a second Sunday in London! However, you can try it if you
      like. Send me a written abstract of the case, and I will forward it to one
      of the official people in the Rue Jerusalem, who will do anything he can
      to oblige me. Of course,&rdquo; said Felix, turning to Mr. Troy, &ldquo;some of you
      have got the number of the lost bank-note? If the thief has tried to pass
      it in Paris, my man may be of some use to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three of us have got the number of the note,&rdquo; answered Mr. Troy; &ldquo;Miss
      Isabel Miller, Mr. Moody, and myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;Send me the number, with the abstract of the
      case. Is there anything else I can do towards recovering the money?&rdquo; he
      asked, turning to his aunt. &ldquo;There is one lucky circumstance in connection
      with this loss&mdash;isn&rsquo;t there? It has fallen on a person who is rich
      enough to take it easy. Good heavens! suppose it had been <i>my</i> loss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has fallen doubly on me,&rdquo; said Lady Lydiard; &ldquo;and I am certainly not
      rich enough to take it <i>that</i> easy. The money was destined to a
      charitable purpose; and I have felt it my duty to pay it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix rose and approached his aunt&rsquo;s chair with faltering steps, as became
      a suffering man. He took Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s hand and kissed it with
      enthusiastic admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You excellent creature!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You may not think it, but you
      reconcile me to human nature. How generous! how noble! I think I&rsquo;ll go to
      bed again, Mr. Troy, if you really don&rsquo;t want any more of me. My head
      feels giddy and my legs tremble under me. It doesn&rsquo;t matter; I shall feel
      easier when Alfred has taken me out of my clothes again. God bless you, my
      dear aunt! I never felt so proud of being related to you as I do to-day.
      Good-morning Mr. Troy! Don&rsquo;t forget the abstract of the case; and don&rsquo;t
      trouble yourself to see me to the door. I dare say I shan&rsquo;t tumble
      downstairs; and, if I do, there&rsquo;s the porter in the hall to pick me up
      again. Enviable porter! as fat as butter and as idle as a pig! <i>Au
      revoir! au revoir!</i>&rdquo; He kissed his hand, and drifted feebly out of the
      room. Sweetsir one might say, in a state of eclipse; but still the
      serviceable Sweetsir, who was never consulted in vain by the fortunate
      people privileged to call him friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he really ill, do you think?&rdquo; Mr. Troy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My nephew has turned fifty,&rdquo; Lady Lydiard answered, &ldquo;and he persists in
      living as if he was a young man. Every now and then Nature says to him,
      &lsquo;Felix, you are old!&rsquo; And Felix goes to bed, and says it&rsquo;s his nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he is to be trusted to keep his word about writing to Paris?&rdquo;
       pursued the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! He may delay doing it but he will do it. In spite of his
      lackadaisical manner, he has moments of energy that would surprise you.
      Talking of surprises, I have something to tell you about Moody. Within the
      last day or two there has been a marked change in him&mdash;a change for
      the worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You astonish me, Lady Lydiard! In what way has Moody deteriorated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall hear. Yesterday was Friday. You took him out with you, on
      business, early in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy bowed, and said nothing. He had not thought it desirable to
      mention the interview at which Old Sharon had cheated him of his guinea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the course of the afternoon,&rdquo; pursued Lady Lydiard, &ldquo;I happened to
      want him, and I was informed that Moody had gone out again. Where had he
      gone? Nobody knew. Had he left word when he would be back? He had left no
      message of any sort. Of course, he is not in the position of an ordinary
      servant. I don&rsquo;t expect him to ask permission to go out. But I do expect
      him to leave word downstairs of the time at which he is likely to return.
      When he did come back, after an absence of some hours, I naturally asked
      for an explanation. Would you believe it? he simply informed me that he
      had been away on business of his own; expressed no regret, and offered no
      explanation&mdash;in short, spoke as if he was an independent gentleman.
      You may not think it, but I kept my temper. I merely remarked that I hoped
      it would not happen again. He made me a bow, and he said, &lsquo;My business is
      not completed yet, my Lady. I cannot guarantee that it may not call me
      away again at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&rsquo; What do you think of that? Nine people
      out of ten would have given him warning to leave their service. I begin to
      think I am a wonderful woman&mdash;I only pointed to the door. One does
      hear sometimes of men&rsquo;s brains softening in the most unexpected manner. I
      have my suspicions of Moody&rsquo;s brains, I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy&rsquo;s suspicions took a different direction: they pointed along the
      line of streets which led to Old Sharon&rsquo;s lodgings. Discreetly silent as
      to the turn which his thoughts had taken, he merely expressed himself as
      feeling too much surprised to offer any opinion at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a little,&rdquo; said Lady Lydiard, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done surprising you yet.
      You have seen a boy here in a page&rsquo;s livery, I think? Well, he is a good
      boy; and he has gone home for a week&rsquo;s holiday with his friends. The
      proper person to supply his place with the boots and shoes and other small
      employments, is of course the youngest footman, a lad only a few years
      older than himself. What do you think Moody does? Engages a stranger, with
      the house full of idle men-servants already, to fill the page&rsquo;s place. At
      intervals this morning I heard them wonderfully merry in the servants hall&mdash;<i>so</i>
      merry that the noise and laughter found its way upstairs to the
      breakfast-room. I like my servants to be in good spirits; but it certainly
      did strike me that they were getting beyond reasonable limits. I
      questioned my maid, and was informed that the noise was all due to the
      jokes of the strangest old man that ever was seen. In other words, to the
      person whom my steward had taken it on himself to engage in the page&rsquo;s
      absence. I spoke to Moody on the subject. He answered in an odd, confused
      way, that he had exercised his discretion to the best of his judgment and
      that (if I wished it), he would tell the old man to keep his good spirits
      under better control. I asked him how he came to hear of the man. He only
      answered, &lsquo;By accident, my Lady&rsquo;&mdash;and not one more word could I get
      out of him, good or bad. Moody engages the servants, as you know; but on
      every other occasion he has invariably consulted me before an engagement
      was settled. I really don&rsquo;t feel at all sure about this person who has
      been so strangely introduced into the house&mdash;he may be a drunkard or
      a thief. I wish you would speak to Moody yourself, Mr. Troy. Do you mind
      ringing the bell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Troy rose, as a matter of course, and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was by this time, it is needless to say, convinced that Moody had not
      only gone back to consult Old Sharon on his own responsibility, but worse
      still, had taken the unwarrantable liberty of introducing him, as a spy,
      into the house. To communicate this explanation to Lady Lydiard would, in
      her present humor, be simply to produce the dismissal of the steward from
      her service. The only other alternative was to ask leave to interrogate
      Moody privately, and, after duly reproving him, to insist on the departure
      of Old Sharon as the one condition on which Mr. Troy would consent to keep
      Lady Lydiard in ignorance of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall manage better with Moody, if your Ladyship will permit me
      to see him in private,&rdquo; the lawyer said. &ldquo;Shall I go downstairs and speak
      with him in his own room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you trouble yourself to do that?&rdquo; said her Ladyship. &ldquo;See him
      here; and I will go into the boudoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she made that reply, the footman appeared at the drawing-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Moody here,&rdquo; said Lady Lydiard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman&rsquo;s answer, delivered at that moment, assumed an importance
      which was not expressed in the footman&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;My Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr.
      Moody has gone out.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHILE the strange proceedings of the steward were the subject of
      conversation between Lady Lydiard and Mr. Troy, Moody was alone in his
      room, occupied in writing to Isabel. Being unwilling that any eyes but his
      own should see the address, he had himself posted his letter; the time
      that he had chosen for leaving the house proving, unfortunately, to be
      also the time proposed by her Ladyship for his interview with the lawyer.
      In ten minutes after the footman had reported his absence, Moody returned.
      It was then too late to present himself in the drawing-room. In the
      interval, Mr. Troy had taken his leave, and Moody&rsquo;s position had dropped a
      degree lower in Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel received her letter by the next morning&rsquo;s post. If any
      justification of Mr. Troy&rsquo;s suspicions had been needed, the terms in which
      Moody wrote would have amply supplied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR ISABEL (I hope I may call you &lsquo;Isabel&rsquo; without offending you, in
      your present trouble?)&mdash;I have a proposal to make, which, whether you
      accept it or not, I beg you will keep a secret from every living creature
      but ourselves. You will understand my request, when I add that these lines
      relate to the matter of tracing the stolen bank-note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been privately in communication with a person in London, who is,
      as I believe, the one person competent to help us in gaining our end. He
      has already made many inquiries in private. With some of them I am
      acquainted; the rest he has thus far kept to himself. The person to whom I
      allude, particularly wishes to have half an hour&rsquo;s conversation with you
      in my presence. I am bound to warn you that he is a very strange and very
      ugly old man; and I can only hope that you will look over his personal
      appearance in consideration of what he is likely to do for your future
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you conveniently meet us, at the further end of the row of villas in
      which your aunt lives, the day after to-morrow, at four o&rsquo;clock? Let me
      have a line to say if you will keep the appointment, and if the hour named
      will suit you. And believe me your devoted friend and servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ROBERT MOODY.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer&rsquo;s warning to her to be careful how she yielded too readily to
      any proposal of Moody&rsquo;s recurred to Isabel&rsquo;s mind while she read those
      lines. Being pledged to secrecy, she could not consult Mr. Troy&mdash;she
      was left to decide for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      No obstacle stood in the way of her free choice of alternatives. After
      their early dinner at three o&rsquo;clock, Miss Pink habitually retired to her
      own room &ldquo;to meditate,&rdquo; as she expressed it. Her &ldquo;meditations&rdquo; inevitably
      ended in a sound sleep of some hours; and during that interval Isabel was
      at liberty to do as she pleased. After considerable hesitation, her
      implicit belief in Moody&rsquo;s truth and devotion, assisted by a strong
      feeling of curiosity to see the companion with whom the steward had
      associated himself, decided Isabel on consenting to keep the appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking up her position beyond the houses, on the day and at the hour
      mentioned by Moody, she believed herself to be fully prepared for the most
      unfavorable impression which the most disagreeable of all possible
      strangers could produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the first appearance of Old Sharon&mdash;as dirty as ever, clothed in
      a long, frowzy, gray overcoat, with his pug-dog at his heels, and his
      smoke-blackened pipe in his mouth, with a tan white hat on his head, which
      looked as if it had been picked up in a gutter, a hideous leer in his
      eyes, and a jaunty trip in his walk&mdash;took her so completely by
      surprise that she could only return Moody&rsquo;s friendly greeting by silently
      pressing his hand. As for Moody&rsquo;s companion, to look at him for a second
      time was more than she had resolution to do. She kept her eyes fixed on
      the pug-dog, and with good reason; as far as appearances went, he was
      indisputably the nobler animal of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the circumstances, the interview threatened to begin in a very
      embarrassing manner. Moody, disheartened by Isabel&rsquo;s silence, made no
      attempt to set the conversation going; he looked as if he meditated a
      hasty retreat to the railway station which he had just left. Fortunately,
      he had at his side the right man (for once) in the right place. Old
      Sharon&rsquo;s effrontery was equal to any emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a nice-looking old man, my dear, am I?&rdquo; he said, leering at
      Isabel with cunning, half-closed eyes. &ldquo;Bless your heart! you&rsquo;ll soon get
      used to me! You see, I am the sort of color, as they say at the
      linen-drapers, that doesn&rsquo;t wash well. It&rsquo;s all through love; upon my life
      it is! Early in the present century I had my young affections blighted;
      and I&rsquo;ve neglected myself ever since. Disappointment takes different
      forms, miss, in different men. I don&rsquo;t think I have had heart enough to
      brush my hair for the last fifty years. She was a magnificent woman, Mr.
      Moody, and she dropped me like a hot potato. Dreadful! dreadful! Let us
      pursue this painful subject no further. Ha! here&rsquo;s a pretty country!
      Here&rsquo;s a nice blue sky! I admire the country, miss; I see so little of it,
      you know. Have you any objection to walk along into the fields? The
      fields, my dear, bring out all the poetry of my nature. Where&rsquo;s the dog?
      Here, Puggy! Puggy! hunt about, my man, and find some dog-grass. Does his
      inside good, you know, after a meat diet in London. Lord! how I feel my
      spirits rising in this fine air! Does my complexion look any brighter,
      miss? Will you run a race with me, Mr. Moody, or will you oblige me with a
      back at leap-frog? I&rsquo;m not mad, my dear young lady; I&rsquo;m only merry. I
      live, you see, in the London stink; and the smell of the hedges and the
      wild flowers is too much for me at first. It gets into my head, it does.
      I&rsquo;m drunk! As I live by bread, I&rsquo;m drunk on fresh air! Oh! what a jolly
      day! Oh! how young and innocent I do feel!&rdquo; Here his innocence got the
      better of him, and he began to sing, &ldquo;I wish I were a little fly, in my
      love&rsquo;s bosom for to lie!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hullo! here we are on the nice soft grass! and,
      oh, my gracious! there&rsquo;s a bank running down into a hollow! I can&rsquo;t stand
      that, you know. Mr. Moody, hold my hat, and take the greatest care of it.
      Here goes for a roll down the bank!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed his horrible hat to the astonished Moody, laid himself flat on
      the top of the bank, and deliberately rolled down it, exactly as he might
      have done when he was a boy. The tails of his long gray coat flew madly in
      the wind: the dog pursued him, jumping over him, and barking with delight;
      he shouted and screamed in answer to the dog as he rolled over and over
      faster and faster; and, when he got up, on the level ground, and called
      out cheerfully to his companions standing above him, &ldquo;I say, you two, I
      feel twenty years younger already!&rdquo;&mdash;human gravity could hold out no
      longer. The sad and silent Moody smiled, and Isabel burst into fits of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I tell you you would get used to me, Miss?
      There&rsquo;s a deal of life left in the old man yet&mdash;isn&rsquo;t there? Shy me
      down my hat, Mr. Moody. And now we&rsquo;ll get to business!&rdquo; He turned round to
      the dog still barking at his heels. &ldquo;Business, Puggy!&rdquo; he called out
      sharply, and Puggy instantly shut up his mouth, and said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; Old Sharon resumed when he had joined his friends and had got
      his breath again, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have a little talk about yourself, miss. Has Mr.
      Moody told you who I am, and what I want with you? Very good. May I offer
      you my arm? No! You like to be independent, don&rsquo;t you? All right&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t object. I am an amiable old man, I am. About this Lady Lydiard, now?
      Suppose you tell me how you first got acquainted with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In some surprise at this question, Isabel told her little story. Observing
      Sharon&rsquo;s face while she was speaking, Moody saw that he was not paying the
      smallest attention to the narrative. His sharp, shameless black eyes
      watched the girl&rsquo;s face absently; his gross lips curled upwards in a
      sardonic and self-satisfied smile. He was evidently setting a trap for her
      of some kind. Without a word of warning&mdash;while Isabel was in the
      middle of a sentence&mdash;the trap opened, with the opening of Old
      Sharon&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;How came <i>you</i> to seal her Ladyship&rsquo;s letter&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question bore no sort of relation, direct or indirect, to what Isabel
      happened to be saying at the moment. In the sudden surprise of hearing it,
      she started and fixed her eyes in astonishment on Sharon&rsquo;s face. The old
      vagabond chuckled to himself. &ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; he whispered to Moody.
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, miss,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t interrupt you again. Lord!
      how interesting it is!&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it, Mr. Moody? Please to go on, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Isabel, though she spoke with perfect sweetness and temper, declined
      to go on. &ldquo;I had better tell you, sir, how I came to seal her Ladyship&rsquo;s
      letter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I may venture on giving my opinion, <i>that</i>
      part of my story seems to be the only part of it which relates to your
      business with me to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further preface she described the circumstances which had led to
      her assuming the perilous responsibility of sealing the letter. Old
      Sharon&rsquo;s wandering attention began to wander again: he was evidently
      occupied in setting another trap. For the second time he interrupted
      Isabel in the middle of a sentence. Suddenly stopping short, he pointed to
      some sheep, at the further end of the field through which they happened to
      be passing at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pretty sight,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are the innocent sheep a-feeding&mdash;all
      following each other as usual. And there&rsquo;s the sly dog waiting behind the
      gate till the sheep wants his services. Reminds me of Old Sharon and the
      public!&rdquo; He chuckled over the discovery of the remarkable similarity
      between the sheep-dog and himself, and the sheep and the public&mdash;and
      then burst upon Isabel with a second question. &ldquo;I say! didn&rsquo;t you look at
      the letter before you sealed it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; Isabel answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even at the address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking of something else&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it your new bonnet, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel laughed. &ldquo;Women are not always thinking of their new bonnets,&rdquo; she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sharon, to all appearance, dropped the subject there. He lifted his
      lean brown forefinger and pointed again&mdash;this time to a house at a
      short distance from them. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a farmhouse, surely?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      thirsty after my roll down the hill. Do you think, Miss, they would give
      me a drink of milk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure they would,&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;I know the people. Shall I go and
      ask them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my dear. One word more before you go. About the sealing of
      that letter? What <i>could</i> you have been thinking of while you were
      doing it?&rdquo; He looked hard at her, and took her suddenly by the arm. &ldquo;Was
      it your sweetheart?&rdquo; he asked, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question instantly reminded Isabel that she had been thinking of
      Hardyman while she sealed the letter. She blushed as the remembrance
      crossed her mind. Robert, noticing the embarrassment, spoke sharply to Old
      Sharon. &ldquo;You have no right to put such a question to a young lady,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Be a little more careful for the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! there! don&rsquo;t be hard on me,&rdquo; pleaded the old rogue. &ldquo;An ugly old
      man like me may make his innocent little joke&mdash;eh, miss? I&rsquo;m sure
      you&rsquo;re too sweet-tempered to be angry when I meant no offense.. Show me
      that you bear no malice. Go, like a forgiving young angel, and ask for the
      milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody appealed to Isabel&rsquo;s sweetness of temper in vain. &ldquo;I will do it
      with pleasure,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and hastened away to the farmhouse.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE instant Isabel was out of hearing, Old Sharon slapped Moody on the
      shoulder to rouse his attention. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got her out of the way,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;now listen to me. My business with the young angel is done&mdash;I may go
      back to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody looked at him with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord! how little you know of thieves!&rdquo; exclaimed Old Sharon. &ldquo;Why, man
      alive, I have tried her with two plain tests! If you wanted a proof of her
      innocence, there it was, as plain as the nose in your face. Did you hear
      me ask her how she came to seal the letter&mdash;just when her mind was
      running on something else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you,&rdquo; said Moody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see how she started and stared at me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can tell you this&mdash;if she <i>had</i> stolen the money she
      would neither have started nor stared. She would have had her answer ready
      beforehand in her own mind, in case of accidents. There&rsquo;s only one thing
      in my experience that you can never do with a thief, when a thief happens
      to be a woman&mdash;you can never take her by surprise. Put that remark by
      in your mind; one day you may find a use for remembering it. Did you see
      her blush, and look quite hurt in her feelings, pretty dear, when I asked
      about her sweetheart? Do you think a thief, in her place, would have shown
      such a face as that? Not she! The thief would have been relieved. The
      thief would have said to herself, &lsquo;All right! the more the old fool talks
      about sweethearts the further he is from tracing the robbery to Me!&rsquo; Yes!
      yes! the ground&rsquo;s cleared now, Master Moody. I&rsquo;ve reckoned up the
      servants; I&rsquo;ve questioned Miss Isabel; I&rsquo;ve made my inquiries in all the
      other quarters that may be useful to us&mdash;and what&rsquo;s the result? The
      advice I gave, when you and the lawyer first came to me&mdash;I hate that
      fellow!&mdash;remains as sound and good advice as ever. I have got the
      thief in my mind,&rdquo; said Old Sharon, closing his cunning eyes and then
      opening them again, &ldquo;as plain as I&rsquo;ve got you in my eye at this minute. No
      more of that now,&rdquo; he went on, looking round sharply at the path that led
      to the farmhouse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something particular to say to you&mdash;and
      there&rsquo;s barely time to say it before that nice girl comes back. Look here!
      Do you happen to be acquainted with Mr.-Honorable-Hardyman&rsquo;s valet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody&rsquo;s eyes rested on Old Sharon with a searching and doubtful look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hardyman&rsquo;s valet?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t prepared to hear Mr.
      Hardyman&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Sharon looked at Moody, in his turn, with a flash of sardonic triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Has my good boy learned his lesson? Do you see the thief
      through my spectacles, already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I began to see him,&rdquo; Moody answered, &ldquo;when you gave us the guinea opinion
      at your lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you whisper his name?&rdquo; asked Old Sharon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. I distrust my own judgment. I wait till time proves that you are
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Sharon knitted his shaggy brows and shook his head. &ldquo;If you had only a
      little more dash and go in you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you would be a clever fellow.
      As it is&mdash;!&rdquo; He finished the sentence by snapping his fingers with a
      grin of contempt. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to business. Are you going back by the next
      train along with me? or are you going to stop with the young lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will follow you by a later train,&rdquo; Moody answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must give you my instructions at once,&rdquo; Sharon continued. &ldquo;You get
      better acquainted with Hardyman&rsquo;s valet. Lend him money if he wants it&mdash;stick
      at nothing to make a bosom friend of him. I can&rsquo;t do that part of it; my
      appearance would be against me. <i>You</i> are the man&mdash;you are
      respectable from the top of your hat to the tips of your boots; nobody
      would suspect You. Don&rsquo;t make objections! Can you fix the valet? Or can&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can try,&rdquo; said Moody. &ldquo;And what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Sharon put his gross lips disagreeably close to Moody&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend the valet can tell you who his master&rsquo;s bankers are,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;and he can supply you with a specimen of his master&rsquo;s handwriting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody drew back, as suddenly as if his vagabond companion had put a knife
      to his throat. &ldquo;You old villain!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are you tempting me to
      forgery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You infernal fool!&rdquo; retorted Old Sharon. &ldquo;<i>Will</i> you hold that long
      tongue of yours, and hear what I have to say. You go to Hardyman&rsquo;s
      bankers, with a note in Hardyman&rsquo;s handwriting (exactly imitated by me) to
      this effect:&mdash;&lsquo;Mr. H. presents his compliments to Messrs. So-and-So,
      and is not quite certain whether a payment of five hundred pounds has been
      made within the last week to his account. He will be much obliged if
      Messrs. So-and-So will inform him by a line in reply, whether there is
      such an entry to his credit in their books, and by whom the payment has
      been made.&rsquo; You wait for the bankers&rsquo; answer, and bring it to me. It&rsquo;s
      just possible that the name you&rsquo;re afraid to whisper may appear in the
      letter. If it does, we&rsquo;ve caught our man. Is <i>that</i> forgery, Mr.
      Muddlehead Moody? I&rsquo;ll tell you what&mdash;if I had lived to be your age,
      and knew no more of the world than you do, I&rsquo;d go and hang myself. Steady!
      here&rsquo;s our charming friend with the milk. Remember your instructions, and
      don&rsquo;t lose heart if my notion of the payment to the bankers comes to
      nothing. I know what to do next, in that case&mdash;and, what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll
      take all the risk and trouble on my own shoulders. Oh, Lord! I&rsquo;m afraid I
      shall be obliged to drink the milk, now it&rsquo;s come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this apprehension in his mind, he advanced to relieve Isabel of the
      jug that she carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a treat!&rdquo; he burst out, with an affectation of joy, which was
      completely belied by the expression of his dirty face. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a kind and
      dear young lady, to help an old man to a drink with her own pretty hands.&rdquo;
       He paused, and looked at the milk very much as he might have looked at a
      dose of physic. &ldquo;Will anyone take a drink first?&rdquo; he asked, offering the
      jug piteously to Isabel and Moody. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m not wed to genuine milk;
      I&rsquo;m used to chalk and water. I don&rsquo;t know what effect the unadulterated
      cow might have on my poor old inside.&rdquo; He tasted the milk with the
      greatest caution. &ldquo;Upon my soul, this is too rich for me! The
      unadulterated cow is a deal too strong to be drunk alone. If you&rsquo;ll allow
      me I&rsquo;ll qualify it with a drop of gin. Here, Puggy, Puggy!&rdquo; He set the
      milk down before the dog; and, taking a flask out of his pocket, emptied
      it at a draught. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something like!&rdquo; he said, smacking his lips with
      an air of infinite relief. &ldquo;So sorry, Miss, to have given you all your
      trouble for nothing; it&rsquo;s my ignorance that&rsquo;s to blame, not me. I couldn&rsquo;t
      know I was unworthy of genuine milk till I tried&mdash;could I? And do you
      know,&rdquo; he proceeded, with his eyes directed slyly on the way back to the
      station, &ldquo;I begin to think I&rsquo;m not worthy of the fresh air, either. A kind
      of longing seems to come over me for the London stink. I&rsquo;m home-sick
      already for the soot of my happy childhood and my own dear native mud. The
      air here is too thin for me, and the sky&rsquo;s too clean; and&mdash;oh, Lord!&mdash;when
      you&rsquo;re wed to the roar of the traffic&mdash;the &lsquo;busses and the cabs and
      what not&mdash;the silence in these parts is downright awful. I&rsquo;ll wish
      you good evening, miss; and get back to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel turned to Moody with disappointment plainly expressed in her face
      and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all he has to say?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You told me he could help us. You
      led me to suppose he could find the guilty person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sharon heard her. &ldquo;I could name the guilty person,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;as
      easily, miss, as I could name you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do it then?&rdquo; Isabel inquired, not very patiently
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the time&rsquo;s not ripe for it yet, miss&mdash;that&rsquo;s one reason.
      Because, if I mentioned the thief&rsquo;s name, as things are now, you, Miss
      Isabel, would think me mad; and you would tell Mr. Moody I had cheated him
      out of his money&mdash;that&rsquo;s another reason. The matter&rsquo;s in train, if
      you will only wait a little longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you say,&rdquo; Isabel rejoined. &ldquo;If you really could name the thief, I
      believe you would do it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away with a frown on her pretty face. Old Sharon followed her.
      Even his coarse sensibilities appeared to feel the irresistible ascendancy
      of beauty and youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;we must part friends, you know&mdash;or I shall break
      my heart over it. They have got milk at the farmhouse. Do you think they
      have got pen, ink, and paper too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel answered, without turning to look at him, &ldquo;Of course they have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a bit of sealing-wax?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Sharon laid his dirty claws on her shoulder and forced her to face him
      as the best means of shaking them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am going to pacify you with some information in
      writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you write it?&rdquo; Isabel asked suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I mean to make my own conditions, my dear, before I let you into
      the secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes more they were all three in the farmhouse parlor. Nobody
      but the farmer&rsquo;s wife was at home. The good woman trembled from head to
      foot at the sight of Old Sharon. In all her harmless life she had never
      yet seen humanity under the aspect in which it was now presented to her.
      &ldquo;Mercy preserve us, Miss!&rdquo; she whispered to Isabel, &ldquo;how come you to be in
      such company as <i>that?</i>&rdquo; Instructed by Isabel, she produced the
      necessary materials for writing and sealing&mdash;and, that done, she
      shrank away to the door. &ldquo;Please to excuse me, miss,&rdquo; she said with a last
      horrified look at her venerable visitor; &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t stand the sight
      of such a blot of dirt as that in my nice clean parlor.&rdquo; With those words
      she disappeared, and was seen no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfectly indifferent to his reception, Old Sharon wrote, inclosed what he
      had written in an envelope; and sealed it (in the absence of anything
      better fitted for his purpose) with the mouthpiece of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, miss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you give me your word of honor,&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped
      and looked round at Moody with a grin&mdash;&ldquo;and you give me yours, that
      you won&rsquo;t either of you break the seal on this envelope till the
      expiration of one week from the present day. There are the conditions,
      Miss Isabel, on which I&rsquo;ll give you your information. If you stop to
      dispute with me, the candle&rsquo;s alight, and I&rsquo;ll burn it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was useless to contend with him. Isabel and Moody gave him the promise
      that he required. He handed the sealed envelope to Isabel with a low bow.
      &ldquo;When the week&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will own I&rsquo;m a cleverer fellow than
      you think me now. Wish you good evening, Miss. Come along, Puggy! Farewell
      to the horrid clean country, and back again to the nice London stink!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded to Moody&mdash;he leered at Isabel&mdash;he chuckled to himself&mdash;he
      left the farmhouse.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ISABEL looked down at the letter in her hand&mdash;considered it in
      silence&mdash;and turned to Moody. &ldquo;I feel tempted to open it already,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After giving your promise?&rdquo; Moody gently remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel met that objection with a woman&rsquo;s logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does a promise matter?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;when one gives it to a dirty,
      disreputable, presuming old wretch like Mr. Sharon? It&rsquo;s a wonder to me
      that you trust such a creature. <i>I</i> wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubted him just as you do,&rdquo; Moody answered, &ldquo;when I first saw him in
      company with Mr. Troy. But there was something in the advice he gave us at
      that first consultation which altered my opinion of him for the better. I
      dislike his appearance and his manners as much as you do&mdash;I may even
      say I felt ashamed of bringing such a person to see you. And yet I can&rsquo;t
      think that I have acted unwisely in employing Mr. Sharon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel listened absently. She had something more to say, and she was
      considering how she should say it. &ldquo;May I ask you a bold question?&rdquo; she
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any question you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated and looked embarrassed. &ldquo;Have you paid Mr.
      Sharon much money?&rdquo; she resumed, suddenly rallying her courage. Instead of
      answering, Moody suggested that it was time to think of returning to Miss
      Pink&rsquo;s villa. &ldquo;Your aunt may be getting anxious about you.&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel led the way out of the farmhouse in silence. She reverted to Mr.
      Sharon and the money, however, as they returned by the path across the
      fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you will not be offended with me,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;if I own
      that I am uneasy about the expense. I am allowing you to use your purse as
      if it was mine&mdash;and I have hardly any savings of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody entreated her not to speak of it. &ldquo;How can I put my money to a
      better use than in serving your interests?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;My one object in
      life is to relieve you of your present anxieties. I shall be the happiest
      man living if you only owe a moment&rsquo;s happiness to my exertions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel took his hand, and looked at him with grateful tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good you are to me, Mr. Moody!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish I could tell you
      how deeply I feel your kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do it easily,&rdquo; he answered, with a smile. &ldquo;Call me &lsquo;Robert&rsquo;&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      call me &lsquo;Mr. Moody.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took his arm with a sudden familiarity that charmed him. &ldquo;If you had
      been my brother I should have called you &lsquo;Robert,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and no
      brother could have been more devoted to me than you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked eagerly at her bright face turned up to his. &ldquo;May I never hope
      to be something nearer and dearer to you than a brother?&rdquo; he asked
      timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung her head and said nothing. Moody&rsquo;s memory recalled Sharon&rsquo;s
      coarse reference to her &ldquo;sweetheart.&rdquo; She had blushed when he put the
      question? What had she done when Moody put <i>his</i> question? Her face
      answered for her&mdash;she had turned pale; she was looking more serious
      than usual. Ignorant as he was of the ways of women, his instinct told him
      that this was a bad sign. Surely her rising color would have confessed it,
      if time and gratitude together were teaching her to love him? He sighed as
      the inevitable conclusion forced itself on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I have not offended you?&rdquo; he said sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had not spoken. Pray don&rsquo;t think that I am serving you with any
      selfish motive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that, Robert. I never could think it of <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not quite satisfied yet. &ldquo;Even if you were to marry some other
      man,&rdquo; he went on earnestly, &ldquo;it would make no difference in what I am
      trying to do for you. No matter what I might suffer, I should still go on&mdash;for
      your sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you talk so?&rdquo; she burst out passionately. &ldquo;No other man has such a
      claim as you to my gratitude and regard. How can you let such thoughts
      come to you? I have done nothing in secret. I have no friends who are not
      known to you. Be satisfied with that, Robert&mdash;and let us drop the
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never to take it up again?&rdquo; he asked, with the infatuated pertinacity of
      a man clinging to his last hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      At other times and under other circumstances, Isabel might have answered
      him sharply. She spoke with perfect gentleness now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for the present,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know my own heart. Give me
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His gratitude caught at those words, as the drowning man is said to catch
      at the proverbial straw. He lifted her hand, and suddenly and fondly
      pressed his lips on it. She showed no confusion. Was she sorry for him,
      poor wretch!&mdash;and was that all?
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on, arm-in-arm, in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the last field, they entered again on the high road leading to
      the row of villas in which Miss Pink lived. The minds of both were
      preoccupied. Neither of them noticed a gentleman approaching on horseback,
      followed by a mounted groom. He was advancing slowly, at the walking-pace
      of his horse, and he only observed the two foot-passengers when he was
      close to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Isabel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started, looked up, and discovered&mdash;Alfred Hardyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dressed in a perfectly-made travelling suit of light brown, with a
      peaked felt hat of a darker shade of the same color, which, in a
      picturesque sense, greatly improved his personal appearance. His pleasure
      at discovering Isabel gave the animation to his features which they wanted
      on ordinary occasions. He sat his horse, a superb hunter, easily and
      gracefully. His light amber-colored gloves fitted him perfectly. His
      obedient servant, on another magnificent horse, waited behind him. He
      looked the impersonation of rank and breeding&mdash;of wealth and
      prosperity. What a contrast, in a woman&rsquo;s eyes, to the shy, pale,
      melancholy man, in the ill-fitting black clothes, with the wandering,
      uneasy glances, who stood beneath him, and felt, and showed that he felt,
      his inferior position keenly! In spite of herself, the treacherous blush
      flew over Isabel&rsquo;s face, in Moody&rsquo;s presence, and with Moody&rsquo;s eyes
      distrustfully watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a piece of good fortune that I hardly hoped for,&rdquo; said Hardyman,
      his cool, quiet, dreary way of speaking quickened as usual, in Isabel&rsquo;s
      presence. &ldquo;I only got back from France this morning, and I called on Lady
      Lydiard in the hope of seeing you. She was not at home&mdash;and you were
      in the country&mdash;and the servants didn&rsquo;t know the address. I could get
      nothing out of them, except that you were on a visit to a relation.&rdquo; He
      looked at Moody while he was speaking. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I seen you before?&rdquo; he
      said, carelessly. &ldquo;Yes; at Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s. You&rsquo;re her steward, are you
      not? How d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo; Moody, with his eyes on the ground, answered silently
      by a bow. Hardyman, perfectly indifferent whether Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s steward
      spoke or not, turned on his saddle and looked admiringly at Isabel. &ldquo;I
      begin to think I am a lucky man at last,&rdquo; he went on with a smile. &ldquo;I was
      jogging along to my farm, and despairing of ever seeing Miss Isabel again&mdash;and
      Miss Isabel herself meets me at the roadside! I wonder whether you are as
      glad to see me as I am to see you? You won&rsquo;t tell me&mdash;eh? May I ask
      you something else? Are you staying in our neighborhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no alternative before Isabel but to answer this last question.
      Hardyman had met her out walking, and had no doubt drawn the inevitable
      inference&mdash;although he was too polite to say so in plain words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she answered, shyly, &ldquo;I am staying in this neighborhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is your relation?&rdquo; Hardyman proceeded, in his easy,
      matter-of-course way. &ldquo;Lady Lydiard told me, when I had the pleasure of
      meeting you at her house, that you had an aunt living in the country. I
      have a good memory, Miss Isabel, for anything that I hear about You! It&rsquo;s
      your aunt, isn&rsquo;t it? Yes? I know everybody about hew. What is your aunt&rsquo;s
      name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel, still resting her hand on Robert&rsquo;s arm, felt it tremble a little
      as Hardyman made this last inquiry. If she had been speaking to one of her
      equals she would have known how to dispose of the question without
      directly answering it. But what could she say to the magnificent gentleman
      on the stately horse? He had only to send his servant into the village to
      ask who the young lady from London was staying with, and the answer, in a
      dozen mouths at least, would direct him to her aunt. She cast one
      appealing look at Moody and pronounced the distinguished name of Miss
      Pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Pink?&rdquo; Hardyman repeated. &ldquo;Surely I know Miss Pink?&rdquo; (He had not the
      faintest remembrances of her.) &ldquo;Where did I meet her last?&rdquo; (He ran over
      in his memory the different local festivals at which strangers had been
      introduced to him.) &ldquo;Was it at the archery meeting? or at the
      grammar-school when the prizes were given? No? It must have been at the
      flower show, then, surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It <i>had</i> been at the flower show. Isabel had heard it from Miss Pink
      fifty times at least, and was obliged to admit it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite ashamed of never having called,&rdquo; Hardyman proceeded. &ldquo;The fact
      is, I have so much to do. I am a bad one at paying visits. Are you on your
      way home? Let me follow you and make my apologies personally to Miss
      Pink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody looked at Isabel. It was only a momentary glance, but she perfectly
      understood it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, sir, my aunt cannot have the honor of seeing you to-day,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman was all compliance. He smiled and patted his horse&rsquo;s neck.
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My compliments, and I will call in the
      afternoon. Let me see: Miss Pink lives at&mdash;?&rdquo; He waited, as if he
      expected Isabel to assist his treacherous memory once more. She hesitated
      again. Hardyman looked round at his groom. The groom could find out the
      address, even if he did not happen to know it already. Besides, there was
      the little row of houses visible at the further end of the road. Isabel
      pointed to the villas, as a necessary concession to good manners, before
      the groom could anticipate her. &ldquo;My aunt lives there, sir; at the house
      called The Lawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! to be sure!&rdquo; said Hardyman. &ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to have wanted reminding; but
      I have so many things to think of at the farm. And I am afraid I must be
      getting old&mdash;my memory isn&rsquo;t as good as it was. I am so glad to have
      seen you, Miss Isabel. You and your aunt must come and look at my horses.
      Do you like horses? Are you fond of riding? I have a quiet roan mare that
      is used to carrying ladies; she would be just the thing for you. Did I beg
      you to give my best compliments to your aunt? Yes? How well you are
      looking! our air here agrees with you. I hope I haven&rsquo;t kept you standing
      too long? I didn&rsquo;t think of it in the pleasure of meeting you. Good-by,
      Miss Isabel; good-by, till to-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took off his hat to Isabel, nodded to Moody, and pursued his way to the
      farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel looked at her companion. His eyes were still on the ground. Pale,
      silent, motionless, he waited by her like a dog, until she gave the signal
      of walking on again towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not angry with me for speaking to Mr. Hardyman?&rdquo; she asked,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his head it the sound of her voice. &ldquo;Angry with you, my dear!
      why should I be angry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem so changed, Robert, since we met Mr. Hardyman. I couldn&rsquo;t help
      speaking to him&mdash;could I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They moved on towards the villa. Isabel was still uneasy. There was
      something in Moody&rsquo;s silent submission to all that she said and all that
      she did which pained and humiliated her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not jealous?&rdquo; she said,
      smiling timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to speak lightly on his side. &ldquo;I have no time to be jealous while
      I have your affairs to look after,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed his arm tenderly. &ldquo;Never fear, Robert, that new friends will
      make me forget the best and dearest friend who is now at my side.&rdquo; She
      paused, and looked up at him with a compassionate fondness that was very
      pretty to see. &ldquo;I can keep out of the way to-morrow, when Mr. Hardyman
      calls,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is my aunt he is coming to see&mdash;not me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was generously meant. But while her mind was only occupied with the
      present time, Moody&rsquo;s mind was looking into the future. He was learning
      the hard lesson of self-sacrifice already. &ldquo;Do what you think is right,&rdquo;
       he said quietly; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached the gate of the villa. He held out his hand to say good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Do come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, my dear. I must get back to London as soon as I can. There is
      some more work to be done for you, and the sooner I do it the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard his excuse without heeding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not like yourself, Robert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why is it? What are you
      thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking of the bright blush that overspread her face when Hardyman
      first spoke to her; he was thinking of the invitation to her to see the
      stud-farm, and to ride the roan mare; he was thinking of the utterly
      powerless position in which he stood towards Isabel and towards the
      highly-born gentleman who admired her. But he kept his doubts and fears to
      himself. &ldquo;The train won&rsquo;t wait for me,&rdquo; he said, and held out his hand
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not only perplexed; she was really distressed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take leave
      of me in that cold way!&rdquo; she pleaded. Her eyes dropped before his, and her
      lips trembled a little. &ldquo;Give me a kiss, Robert, at parting.&rdquo; She said
      those bold words softly and sadly, out of the depth of her pity for him.
      He started; his face brightened suddenly; his sinking hope rose again. In
      another moment the change came; in another moment he understood her. As he
      touched her cheek with his lips, he turned pale again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quite forget
      me,&rdquo; he said, in low, faltering tones&mdash;and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink met Isabel in the hall. Refreshed by unbroken repose, the
      ex-schoolmistress was in the happiest frame of mind for the reception of
      her niece&rsquo;s news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Informed that Moody had travelled to South Morden to personally report the
      progress of the inquiries, Miss Pink highly approved of him as a
      substitute for Mr. Troy. &ldquo;Mr. Moody, as a banker&rsquo;s son, is a gentleman by
      birth,&rdquo; she remarked; &ldquo;he has condescended, in becoming Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s
      steward. What I saw of him, when he came here with you, prepossessed me in
      his favor. He has my confidence, Isabel, as well as yours&mdash;he is in
      every respect a superior person to Mr. Troy. Did you meet any friends, my
      dear, when you were out walking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer to this question produced a species of transformation in Miss
      Pink. The rapturous rank-worship of her nation feasted, so to speak, on
      Hardyman&rsquo;s message. She looked taller and younger than usual&mdash;she was
      all smiles and sweetness. &ldquo;At last, Isabel, you have seen birth and
      breeding under their right aspect,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In the society of Lady
      Lydiard, you cannot possibly have formed correct ideas of the English
      aristocracy. Observe Mr. Hardyman when he does me the honor to call
      to-morrow&mdash;and you will see the difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hardyman is your visitor, aunt&mdash;not mine. I was going to ask you
      to let me remain upstairs in my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink was unaffectedly shocked. &ldquo;This is what you learn at Lady
      Lydiard&rsquo;s!&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;No, Isabel, your absence would be a breach of
      good manners&mdash;I cannot possibly permit it. You will be present to
      receive our distinguished friend with me. And mind this!&rdquo; added Miss Pink,
      in her most impressive manner, &ldquo;If Mr. Hardyman should by any chance ask
      why you have left Lady Lydiard, not one word about those disgraceful
      circumstances which connect you with the loss of the banknote! I should
      sink into the earth if the smallest hint of what has really happened
      should reach Mr. Hardyman&rsquo;s ears. My child, I stand towards you in the
      place of your lamented mother; I have the right to command your silence on
      this horrible subject, and I do imperatively command it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In these words foolish Miss Pink sowed the seed for the harvest of trouble
      that was soon to come.

      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      PAYING his court to the ex-schoolmistress on the next day, Hardyman made
      such excellent use of his opportunities that the visit to the stud-farm
      took place on the day after. His own carriage was placed at the disposal
      of Isabel and her aunt; and his own sister was present to confer special
      distinction on the reception of Miss Pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a country like England, which annually suspends the sitting of its
      Legislature in honor of a horse-race, it is only natural and proper that
      the comfort of the horses should be the first object of consideration at a
      stud-farm. Nine-tenths of the land at Hardyman&rsquo;s farm was devoted, in one
      way or another, to the noble quadruped with the low forehead and the long
      nose. Poor humanity was satisfied with second-rate and third-rate
      accommodation. The ornamental grounds, very poorly laid out, were also
      very limited in extent&mdash;and, as for the dwelling-house, it was
      literally a cottage. A parlor and a kitchen, a smoking-room, a bed-room,
      and a spare chamber for a friend, all scantily furnished, sufficed for the
      modest wants of the owner of the property. If you wished to feast your
      eyes on luxury you went to the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stud-farm being described, the introduction to Hardyman&rsquo;s sister
      follows in due course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Lavinia Hardyman was, as all persons in society know,
      married rather late in life to General Drumblade. It is saying a great
      deal, but it is not saying too much, to describe Mrs. Drumblade as the
      most mischievous woman of her age in all England. Scandal was the breath
      of her life; to place people in false positions, to divulge secrets and
      destroy characters, to undermine friendships, and aggravate enmities&mdash;these
      were the sources of enjoyment from which this dangerous woman drew the
      inexhaustible fund of good spirits that made her a brilliant light in the
      social sphere. She was one of the privileged sinners of modern society.
      The worst mischief that she could work was ascribed to her &ldquo;exuberant
      vitality.&rdquo; She had that ready familiarity of manner which is (in <i>her</i>
      class) so rarely discovered to be insolence in disguise. Her power of easy
      self-assertion found people ready to accept her on her own terms wherever
      she went. She was one of those big, overpowering women, with blunt
      manners, voluble tongues, and goggle eyes, who carry everything before
      them. The highest society modestly considered itself in danger of being
      dull in the absence of Mrs. Drumblade. Even Hardyman himself&mdash;who saw
      as little of her as possible, whose frankly straightforward nature
      recoiled by instinct from contact with his sister&mdash;could think of no
      fitter person to make Miss Pink&rsquo;s reception agreeable to her, while he was
      devoting his own attentions to her niece. Mrs. Drumblade accepted the
      position thus offered with the most amiable readiness. In her own private
      mind she placed an interpretation on her brother&rsquo;s motives which did him
      the grossest injustice. She believed that Hardyman&rsquo;s designs on Isabel
      contemplated the most profligate result. To assist this purpose, while the
      girl&rsquo;s nearest relative was supposed to be taking care of her, was Mrs.
      Drumblade&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;fun.&rdquo; Her worst enemies admitted that the honorable
      Lavinia had redeeming qualities, and owned that a keen sense of humor was
      one of her merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Miss Pink a likely person to resist the fascinations of Mrs.
      Drumblade? Alas, for the ex-schoolmistress! before she had been five
      minutes at the farm, Hardyman&rsquo;s sister had fished for her, caught her,
      landed her. Poor Miss Pink!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Drumblade could assume a grave dignity of manner when the occasion
      called for it. She was grave, she was dignified, when Hardyman performed
      the ceremonies of introduction. She would not say she was charmed to meet
      Miss Pink&mdash;the ordinary slang of society was not for Miss Pink&rsquo;s ears&mdash;she
      would say she felt this introduction as a privilege. It was so seldom one
      met with persons of trained intellect in society. Mrs. Drumblade was
      already informed of Miss Pink&rsquo;s earlier triumphs in the instruction of
      youth. Mrs. Drumblade had not been blessed with children herself; but she
      had nephews and nieces, and she was anxious about their education,
      especially the nieces. What a sweet, modest girl Miss Isabel was! The
      fondest wish she could form for her nieces would be that they should
      resemble Miss Isabel when they grew up. The question was, as to the best
      method of education. She would own that she had selfish motives in
      becoming acquainted with Miss Pink. They were at the farm, no doubt, to
      see Alfred&rsquo;s horses. Mrs. Drumblade did not understand horses; her
      interest was in the question of education. She might even confess that she
      had accepted Alfred&rsquo;s invitation in the hope of hearing Miss Pink&rsquo;s views.
      There would be opportunities, she trusted, for a little instructive
      conversation on that subject. It was, perhaps, ridiculous to talk, at her
      age, of feeling as if she was Miss Pink&rsquo;s pupil; and yet it exactly
      expressed the nature of the aspiration which was then in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these terms, feeling her way with the utmost nicety, Mrs. Drumblade
      wound the net of flattery round and round Miss Pink until her hold on that
      innocent lady was, in every sense of the word, secure. Before half the
      horses had been passed under review, Hardyman and Isabel were out of
      sight, and Mrs. Drumblade and Miss Pink were lost in the intricacies of
      the stables. &ldquo;Excessively stupid of me! We had better go back, and
      establish ourselves comfortably in the parlor. When my brother misses us,
      he and your charming niece will return to look for us in the cottage.&rdquo;
       Under cover of this arrangement the separation became complete. Miss Pink
      held forth on education to Mrs. Drumblade in the parlor; while Hardyman
      and Isabel were on their way to a paddock at the farthest limits of the
      property.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you are getting a little tired,&rdquo; said Hardyman. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you
      take my arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel was on her guard: she had not forgotten what Lady Lydiard had said
      to her. &ldquo;No, thank you, Mr. Hardyman; I am a better walker than you
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman continued the conversation in his blunt, resolute way. &ldquo;I wonder
      whether you will believe me,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;if I tell you that this is one of
      the happiest days of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you were always happy,&rdquo; Isabel cautiously replied, &ldquo;having
      such a pretty place to live in as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman met that answer with one of his quietly-positive denials. &ldquo;A man
      is never happy by himself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is happy with a companion. For
      instance, I am happy with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel stopped and looked back. Hardyman&rsquo;s language was becoming a little
      too explicit. &ldquo;Surely we have lost Mrs. Drumblade and my aunt,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see them anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see them directly; they are only a long way behind.&rdquo; With this
      assurance, he returned, in his own obstinate way, to his one object in
      view. &ldquo;Miss Isabel, I want to ask you a question. I&rsquo;m not a ladies&rsquo; man. I
      speak my mind plainly to everybody&mdash;women included. Do you like being
      here to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel&rsquo;s gravity was not proof against this very downright question. &ldquo;I
      should be hard to please,&rdquo; she said laughing, &ldquo;if I didn&rsquo;t enjoy my visit
      to the farm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman pushed steadily forward through the obstacle of the farm to the
      question of the farm&rsquo;s master. &ldquo;You like being here,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Do you
      like Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was serious. Isabel drew back a little, and looked at him. He waited
      with the most impenetrable gravity for her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you can hardly expect me to answer that question,&rdquo; she said
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our acquaintance has been a very short one, Mr. Hardyman. And, if <i>you</i>
      are so good as to forget the difference between us, I think <i>I</i> ought
      to remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The difference in rank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman suddenly stood still, and emphasized his next words by digging
      his stick into the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anything I have said has vexed you,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;tell me so plainly,
      Miss Isabel, and I&rsquo;ll ask your pardon. But don&rsquo;t throw my rank in my face.
      I cut adrift from all that nonsense when I took this farm and got my
      living out of the horses. What has a man&rsquo;s rank to do with a man&rsquo;s
      feelings?&rdquo; he went on, with another emphatic dig of his stick. &ldquo;I am quite
      serious in asking if you like me&mdash;for this good reason, that I like
      you. Yes, I do. You remember that day when I bled the old lady&rsquo;s dog&mdash;well,
      I have found out since then that there&rsquo;s a sort of incompleteness in my
      life which I never suspected before. It&rsquo;s you who have put that idea into
      my head. You didn&rsquo;t mean it, I dare say, but you have done it all the
      same. I sat alone here yesterday evening smoking my pipe&mdash;and I
      didn&rsquo;t enjoy it. I breakfasted alone this morning&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t enjoy
      <i>that</i>. I said to myself, She&rsquo;s coming to lunch, that&rsquo;s one comfort&mdash;I
      shall enjoy lunch. That&rsquo;s what I feel, roughly described. I don&rsquo;t suppose
      I&rsquo;ve been five minutes together without thinking of you, now in one way
      and now in another, since the day when I first saw you. When a man comes
      to my time of life, and has had any experience, he knows what that means.
      It means, in plain English, that his heart is set on a woman. You&rsquo;re the
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel had thus far made several attempts to interrupt him, without
      success. But, when Hardyman&rsquo;s confession attained its culminating point,
      she insisted on being heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will excuse me, sir,&rdquo; she interposed gravely, &ldquo;I think I had
      better go back to the cottage. My aunt is a stranger here, and she doesn&rsquo;t
      know where to look for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want your aunt,&rdquo; Hardyman remarked, in his most positive manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do want her,&rdquo; Isabel rejoined. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t venture to say it&rsquo;s wrong in
      you, Mr. Hardyman, to talk to me as you have just done, but I am quite
      sure it&rsquo;s very wrong of me to listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with such unaffected surprise and distress that she
      stopped, on the point of leaving him, and tried to make herself better
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no intention of offending you, sir,&rdquo; she said, a little confusedly.
      &ldquo;I only wanted to remind you that there are some things which a gentleman
      in your position&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, tried to finish the sentence,
      failed, and began another. &ldquo;If I had been a young lady in your own rank of
      life,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I might have thanked you for paying me a compliment,
      and have given you a serious answer. As it is, I am afraid that I must say
      that you have surprised and disappointed me. I can claim very little for
      myself, I know. But I did imagine&mdash;so long as there was nothing
      unbecoming in my conduct&mdash;that I had some right to your respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Listening more and more impatiently, Hardyman took her by the hand, and
      burst out with another of his abrupt questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you possibly be thinking of?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him no answer; she only looked at him reproachfully, and tried to
      release herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman held her hand faster than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you think me an infernal scoundrel!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can stand a
      good deal, Miss Isabel, but I can&rsquo;t stand <i>that</i>. How have I failed
      in respect toward you, if you please? I have told you you&rsquo;re the woman my
      heart is set on. Well? Isn&rsquo;t it plain what I want of you, when I say that?
      Isabel Miller, I want you to be my wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel&rsquo;s only reply to this extraordinary proposal of marriage was a faint
      cry of astonishment, followed by a sudden trembling that shook her from
      head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman put his arm round her with a gentleness which his oldest friend
      would have been surprised to see in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your time to think of it,&rdquo; he said, dropping back again into his
      usual quiet tone. &ldquo;If you had known me a little better you wouldn&rsquo;t have
      mistaken me, and you wouldn&rsquo;t be looking at me now as if you were afraid
      to believe your own ears. What is there so very wonderful in my wanting to
      marry you? I don&rsquo;t set up for being a saint. When I was a younger man I
      was no better (and no worse) than other young men. I&rsquo;m getting on now to
      middle life. I don&rsquo;t want romances and adventures&mdash;I want an easy
      existence with a nice lovable woman who will make me a good wife. You&rsquo;re
      the woman, I tell you again. I know it by what I&rsquo;ve seen of you myself,
      and by what I have heard of you from Lady Lydiard. She said you were
      prudent, and sweet-tempered, and affectionate; to which I wish to add that
      you have just the face and figure that I like, and the modest manners and
      the blessed absence of all slang in your talk, which I don&rsquo;t find in the
      young women I meet with in the present day. That&rsquo;s my view of it: I think
      for myself. What does it matter to me whether you&rsquo;re the daughter of a
      Duke or the daughter of a Dairyman? It isn&rsquo;t your father I want to marry&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      you. Listen to reason, there&rsquo;s a dear! We have only one question to settle
      before we go back to your aunt. You wouldn&rsquo;t answer me when I asked it a
      little while since. Will you answer now? <i>Do</i> you like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel looked up at him timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my position, sir,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;have I any right to like you? What
      would your relations and friends think, if I said Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman gave her waist a little admonitory squeeze with his arm
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You&rsquo;re at it again? A nice way to answer a man, to call him &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; 
      and to get behind his rank as if it was a place of refuge from him! I hate
      talking of myself, but you force me to it. Here is my position in the
      world&mdash;I have got an elder brother; he is married, and he has a son
      to succeed him, in the title and the property. You understand, so far?
      Very well! Years ago I shifted my share of the rank (whatever it may be)
      on to my brother&rsquo;s shoulders. He is a thorough good fellow, and he has
      carried my dignity for me, without once dropping it, ever since. As for
      what people may say, they have said it already, from my father and mother
      downward, in the time when I took to the horses and the farm. If they&rsquo;re
      the wise people I take them for, they won&rsquo;t be at the trouble of saying it
      all over again. No, no. Twist it how you may, Miss Isabel, whether I&rsquo;m
      single or whether I&rsquo;m married, I&rsquo;m plain Alfred Hardyman; and everybody
      who knows me knows that I go on my way, and please myself. If you don&rsquo;t
      like me, it will be the bitterest disappointment I ever had in my life;
      but say so honestly, all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Where is the woman in Isabel&rsquo;s place whose capacity for resistance would
      not have yielded a little to such an appeal as this?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be an insensible wretch,&rdquo; she replied warmly, &ldquo;if I didn&rsquo;t feel
      the honor you have done me, and feel it gratefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that mean you will have me for a husband?&rdquo; asked downright Hardyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was fairly driven into a corner; but (being a woman) she tried to slip
      through his fingers at the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you forgive me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I ask you for a little more time? I
      am so bewildered, I hardly know what to say or do for the best. You see,
      Mr. Hardyman, it would be a dreadful thing for me to be the cause of
      giving offense to your family. I am obliged to think of that. It would be
      so distressing for you (I will say nothing of myself) if your friends
      closed their doors on me. They might say I was a designing girl, who had
      taken advantage of your good opinion to raise herself in the world. Lady
      Lydiard warned me long since not to be ambitious about myself and not to
      forget my station in life, because she treated me like her adopted
      daughter. Indeed&mdash;indeed, I can&rsquo;t tell you how I feel your goodness,
      and the compliment&mdash;the very great compliment, you pay me! My heart
      is free, and if I followed my own inclinations&mdash;&rdquo; She checked
      herself, conscious that she was on the brink of saying too much. &ldquo;Will you
      give me a few days,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;to try if I can think composedly of all
      this? I am only a girl, and I feel quite dazzled by the prospect that you
      set before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman seized on those words as offering all the encouragement that he
      desired to his suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have your own way in this thing and in everything!&rdquo; he said, with an
      unaccustomed fervor of language and manner. &ldquo;I am so glad to hear that
      your heart is open to me, and that all your inclinations take my part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel instantly protested against this misrepresentation of what she had
      really said, &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Hardyman, you quite mistake me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered her very much as he had answered Lady Lydiard, when she had
      tried to make him understand his proper relations towards Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I don&rsquo;t mistake you. I agree to every word you say. How can I
      expect you to marry me, as you very properly remark, unless I give you a
      day or two to make up your mind? It&rsquo;s quite enough for me that you like
      the prospect. If Lady Lydiard treated you as her daughter, why shouldn&rsquo;t
      you be my wife? It stands to reason that you&rsquo;re quite right to marry a man
      who can raise you in the world. I like you to be ambitious&mdash;though
      Heaven knows it isn&rsquo;t much I can do for you, except to love you with all
      my heart. Still, it&rsquo;s a great encouragement to hear that her Ladyship&rsquo;s
      views agree with mine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t agree, Mr. Hardyman!&rdquo; protested poor Isabel. &ldquo;You are entirely
      misrepresenting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman cordially concurred in this view of the matter. &ldquo;Yes! yes! I
      can&rsquo;t pretend to represent her Ladyship&rsquo;s language, or yours either; I am
      obliged to take my words as they come to me. Don&rsquo;t disturb yourself: it&rsquo;s
      all right&mdash;I understand. You have made me the happiest man living. I
      shall ride over to-morrow to your aunt&rsquo;s house, and hear what you have to
      say to me. Mind you&rsquo;re at home! Not a day must pass now without my seeing
      you. I do love you, Isabel&mdash;I do, indeed!&rdquo; He stooped, and kissed her
      heartily. &ldquo;Only to reward me,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;for giving you time to
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself away from him&mdash;resolutely, not angrily. Before she
      could make a third attempt to place the subject in its right light before
      him, the luncheon bell rang at the cottage&mdash;and a servant appeared
      evidently sent to look for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to-morrow,&rdquo; Hardyman whispered confidentially. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call
      early&mdash;and then go to London, and get the ring.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      EVENTS succeeded each other rapidly, after the memorable day to Isabel of
      the luncheon at the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day (the ninth of the month) Lady Lydiard sent for her
      steward, and requested him to explain his conduct in repeatedly leaving
      the house without assigning any reason for his absence. She did not
      dispute his claims to a freedom of action which would not be permitted to
      an ordinary servant. Her objection to his present course of proceeding
      related entirely to the mystery in which it was involved, and to the
      uncertainty in which the household was left as to the hour of his return.
      On those grounds, she thought herself entitled to an explanation. Moody&rsquo;s
      habitual reserve&mdash;strengthened, on this occasion, by his dread of
      ridicule, if his efforts to serve Isabel ended in failure&mdash;disinclined
      him to take Lady Lydiard into his confidence, while his inquiries were
      still beset with obstacles and doubts. He respectfully entreated her
      Ladyship to grant him a delay of a few weeks before he entered on his
      explanation. Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s quick temper resented his request. She told
      Moody plainly that he was guilty of an act of presumption in making his
      own conditions with his employer. He received the reproof with exemplary
      resignation; but he held to his conditions nevertheless. From that moment
      the result of the interview was no longer in doubt. Moody was directed to
      send in his accounts. The accounts having been examined, and found to be
      scrupulously correct, he declined accepting the balance of salary that was
      offered to him. The next day he left Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s service.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the tenth of the month her Ladyship received a letter from her nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The health of Felix had not improved. He had made up his mind to go abroad
      again towards the end of the month. In the meantime, he had written to his
      friend in Paris, and he had the pleasure of forwarding an answer. The
      letter inclosed announced that the lost five-hundred-pound note had been
      made the subject of careful inquiry in Paris. It had not been traced. The
      French police offered to send to London one of their best men, well
      acquainted with the English language, if Lady Lydiard was desirous of
      employing him. He would be perfectly willing to act with an English
      officer in conducting the investigation, should it be thought necessary.
      Mr. Troy being consulted as to the expediency of accepting this proposal,
      objected to the pecuniary terms demanded as being extravagantly high. He
      suggested waiting a little before any reply was sent to Paris; and he
      engaged meanwhile to consult a London solicitor who had great experience
      in cases of theft, and whose advice might enable them to dispense entirely
      with the services of the French police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being now a free man again, Moody was able to follow his own inclinations
      in regard to the instructions which he had received from Old Sharon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course that had been recommended to him was repellent to the
      self-respect and the sense of delicacy which were among the inbred virtues
      of Moody&rsquo;s character. He shrank from forcing himself as a friend on
      Hardyman&rsquo;s valet: he recoiled from the idea of tempting the man to steal a
      specimen of his master&rsquo;s handwriting. After some consideration, he decided
      on applying to the agent who collected the rents at Hardyman&rsquo;s London
      chambers. Being an old acquaintance of Moody&rsquo;s, this person would
      certainly not hesitate to communicate the address of Hardyman&rsquo;s bankers,
      if he knew it. The experiment, tried under these favoring circumstances,
      proved perfectly successful. Moody proceeded to Sharon&rsquo;s lodgings the same
      day, with the address of the bankers in his pocketbook. The old vagabond,
      greatly amused by Moody&rsquo;s scruples, saw plainly enough that, so long as he
      wrote the supposed letter from Hardyman in the third person, it mattered
      little what handwriting was employed, seeing that no signature would be
      necessary. The letter was at once composed, on the model which Sharon had
      already suggested to Moody, and a respectable messenger (so far as outward
      appearances went) was employed to take it to the bank. In half an hour the
      answer came back. It added one more to the difficulties which beset the
      inquiry after the lost money. No such sum as five hundred pounds had been
      paid, within the dates mentioned, to the credit of Hardyman&rsquo;s account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sharon was not in the least discomposed by this fresh check. &ldquo;Give my
      love to the dear young lady,&rdquo; he said with his customary impudence; &ldquo;and
      tell her we are one degree nearer to finding the thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody looked at him, doubting whether he was in jest or in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I squeeze a little more information into that thick head of yours?&rdquo;
       asked Sharon. With this question he produced a weekly newspaper, and
      pointed to a paragraph which reported, among the items of sporting news,
      Hardyman&rsquo;s recent visit to a sale of horses at a town in the north of
      France. &ldquo;We know he didn&rsquo;t pay the bank-note in to his account,&rdquo; Sharon
      remarked. &ldquo;What else did he do with it? Took it to pay for the horses that
      he bought in France! Do you see your way a little plainer now? Very good.
      Let&rsquo;s try next if your money holds out. Somebody must cross the Channel in
      search of the note. Which of us two is to sit in the steam-boat with a
      white basin on his lap? Old Sharon, of course!&rdquo; He stopped to count the
      money still left, out of the sum deposited by Moody to defray the cost of
      the inquiry. &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got enough to pay my expenses
      there and back. Don&rsquo;t stir out of London till you hear from me. I can&rsquo;t
      tell how soon I may not want you. If there&rsquo;s any difficulty in tracing the
      note, your hand will have to go into your pocket again. Can&rsquo;t you get the
      lawyer to join you? Lord! how I should enjoy squandering <i>his</i> money!
      It&rsquo;s a downright disgrace to me to have only got one guinea out of him. I
      could tear my flesh off my bones when I think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same night Old Sharon started for France, by way of Dover and Calais.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days elapsed, and brought no news from Moody&rsquo;s agent. On the third
      day, he received some information relating to Sharon&mdash;not from the
      man himself, but in a letter from Isabel Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For once, dear Robert,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;my judgment has turned out to be
      sounder than yours. That hateful old man has confirmed my worst opinion of
      him. Pray have him punished. Take him before a magistrate and charge him
      with cheating you out of your money. I inclose the sealed letter which he
      gave me at the farmhouse. The week&rsquo;s time before I was to open it expired
      yesterday. Was there ever anything so impudent and so inhuman? I am too
      vexed and angry about the money you have wasted on this old wretch to
      write more. Yours, gratefully and affectionately, Isabel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter in which Old Sharon had undertaken (by way of pacifying Isabel)
      to write the name of the thief, contained these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a charming girl, my dear; but you still want one thing to make
      you perfect&mdash;and that is a lesson in patience. I am proud and happy
      to teach you. The name of the thief remains, for the present, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
      (Blank).&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From Moody&rsquo;s point of view, there was but one thing to be said of this: it
      was just like Old Sharon! Isabel&rsquo;s letter was of infinitely greater
      interest to him. He feasted his eyes on the words above the signature: she
      signed herself, &ldquo;Yours gratefully and affectionately.&rdquo; Did the last words
      mean that she was really beginning to be fond of him? After kissing the
      word, he wrote a comforting letter to her, in which he pledged himself to
      keep a watchful eye on Sharon, and to trust him with no more money until
      he had honestly earned it first.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week passed. Moody (longing to see Isabel) still waited in vain for news
      from France. He had just decided to delay his visit to South Morden no
      longer, when the errand-boy employed by Sharon brought him this message:
      &ldquo;The old &lsquo;un&rsquo;s at home, and waitin&rsquo; to see yer.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SHARON&rsquo;S news was not of an encouraging character. He had met with serious
      difficulties, and had spent the last farthing of Moody&rsquo;s money in
      attempting to overcome them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One discovery of importance he had certainly made. A horse withdrawn from
      the sale was the only horse that had met with Hardyman&rsquo;s approval. He had
      secured the animal at the high reserved price of twelve thousand francs&mdash;being
      four hundred and eighty pounds in English money; and he had paid with an
      English bank-note. The seller (a French horse-dealer resident in Brussels)
      had returned to Belgium immediately on completing the negotiations. Sharon
      had ascertained his address, and had written to him at Brussels, inclosing
      the number of the lost banknote. In two days he had received an answer,
      informing him that the horse-dealer had been called to England by the
      illness of a relative, and that he had hitherto failed to send any address
      to which his letters could be forwarded. Hearing this, and having
      exhausted his funds, Sharon had returned to London. It now rested with
      Moody to decide whether the course of the inquiry should follow the
      horse-dealer next. Here was the cash account, showing how the money had
      been spent. And there was Sharon, with his pipe in his mouth and his dog
      on his lap, waiting for orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moody wisely took time to consider before he committed himself to a
      decision. In the meanwhile, he ventured to recommend a new course of
      proceeding which Sharon&rsquo;s report had suggested to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we have taken the roundabout way of
      getting to our end in view, when the straight road lay before us. If Mr.
      Hardyman has passed the stolen note, you know, as well as I do, that he
      has passed it innocently. Instead of wasting time and money in trying to
      trace a stranger, why not tell Mr. Hardyman what has happened, and ask him
      to give us the number of the note? You can&rsquo;t think of everything, I know;
      but it does seem strange that this idea didn&rsquo;t occur to you before you
      went to France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Moody,&rdquo; said Old Sharon, &ldquo;I shall have to cut your acquaintance. You
      are a man without faith; I don&rsquo;t like you. As if I hadn&rsquo;t thought of
      Hardyman weeks since!&rdquo; he exclaimed contemptuously. &ldquo;Are you really soft
      enough to suppose that a gentleman in his position would talk about his
      money affairs to me? You know mighty little of him if you do. A fortnight
      since I sent one of my men (most respectably dressed) to hang about his
      farm, and see what information he could pick up. My man became painfully
      acquainted with the toe of a boot. It was thick, sir; and it was
      Hardyman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will run the risk of the boot,&rdquo; Moody replied, in his quiet way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And put the question to Hardyman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Sharon. &ldquo;If you get your answer from his tongue, instead
      of his boot, the case is cleared up&mdash;unless I have made a complete
      mess of it. Look here, Moody! If you want to do me a good turn, tell the
      lawyer that the guinea-opinion was the right one. Let him know that <i>he</i>
      was the fool, not you, when he buttoned up his pockets and refused to
      trust me. And, I say,&rdquo; pursued Old Sharon, relapsing into his customary
      impudence, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re in love, you know, with that nice girl. I like her
      myself. When you marry her invite me to the wedding. I&rsquo;ll make a
      sacrifice; I&rsquo;ll brush my hair and wash my face in honor of the occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Returning to his lodgings, Moody found two letters waiting on the table.
      One of them bore the South Morden postmark. He opened that letter first.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was written by Miss Pink. The first lines contained an urgent entreaty
      to keep the circumstances connected with the loss of the five hundred
      pounds the strictest secret from everyone in general, and from Hardyman in
      particular. The reasons assigned for making the strange request were next
      expressed in these terms: &ldquo;My niece Isabel is, I am happy to inform you,
      engaged to be married to Mr. Hardyman. If the slightest hint reached him
      of her having been associated, no matter how cruelly and unjustly, with a
      suspicion of theft, the marriage would be broken off, and the result to
      herself and to everybody connected with her, would be disgrace for the
      rest of our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the blank space at the foot of the page a few words were added in
      Isabel&rsquo;s writing: &ldquo;Whatever changes there may be in my life, your place in
      my heart is one that no other person can fill: it is the place of my
      dearest friend. Pray write and tell me that you are not distressed and not
      angry. My one anxiety is that you should remember what I have always told
      you about the state of my own feelings. My one wish is that you will still
      let me love you and value you, as I might have loved and valued a
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter dropped from Moody&rsquo;s hand. Not a word&mdash;not even a sigh&mdash;passed
      his lips. In tearless silence he submitted to the pang that wrung him. In
      tearless silence he contemplated the wreck of his life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE narrative returns to South Morden, and follows the events which
      attended Isabel&rsquo;s marriage engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      To say that Miss Pink, inflated by the triumph, rose, morally speaking,
      from the earth and floated among the clouds, is to indicate faintly the
      effect produced on the ex-schoolmistress when her niece first informed her
      of what had happened at the farm. Attacked on one side by her aunt, and on
      the other by Hardyman, and feebly defended, at the best, by her own doubts
      and misgivings, Isabel ended by surrendering at discretion. Like thousands
      of other women in a similar position, she was in the last degree uncertain
      as to the state of her own heart. To what extent she was insensibly
      influenced by Hardyman&rsquo;s commanding position in believing herself to be
      sincerely attached to him, it was beyond her power of self-examination to
      discover. He doubly dazzled her by his birth and by his celebrity. Not in
      England only, but throughout Europe, he was a recognized authority on his
      own subject. How could she&mdash;how could any woman&mdash;resist the
      influence of his steady mind, his firmness of purpose, his manly
      resolution to owe everything to himself and nothing to his rank, set off
      as these attractive qualities were by the outward and personal advantages
      which exercise an ascendancy of their own? Isabel was fascinated, and yet
      Isabel was not at ease. In her lonely moments she was troubled by
      regretful thoughts of Moody, which perplexed and irritated her. She had
      always behaved honestly to him; she had never encouraged him to hope that
      his love for her had the faintest prospect of being returned. Yet,
      knowing, as she did, that her conduct was blameless so far, there were
      nevertheless perverse sympathies in her which took his part. In the
      wakeful hours of the night there were whispering voices in her which said:
      &ldquo;Think of Moody!&rdquo; Had there been a growing kindness towards this good
      friend in her heart, of which she herself was not aware? She tried to
      detect it&mdash;to weigh it for what it was really worth. But it lay too
      deep to be discovered and estimated, if it did really exist&mdash;if it
      had any sounder origin than her own morbid fancy. In the broad light of
      day, in the little bustling duties of life, she forgot it again. She could
      think of what she ought to wear on the wedding day; she could even try
      privately how her new signature, &ldquo;Isabel Hardyman,&rdquo; would look when she
      had the right to use it. On the whole, it may be said that the time passed
      smoothly&mdash;with some occasional checks and drawbacks, which were the
      more easily endured seeing that they took their rise in Isabel&rsquo;s own
      conduct. Compliant as she was in general, there were two instances, among
      others, in which her resolution to take her own way was not to be
      overcome. She refused to write either to Moody or to Lady Lydiard
      informing them of her engagement; and she steadily disapproved of Miss
      Pink&rsquo;s policy of concealment, in the matter of the robbery at Lady
      Lydiard&rsquo;s house. Her aunt could only secure her as a passive accomplice by
      stating family considerations in the strongest possible terms. &ldquo;If the
      disgrace was confined to you, my dear, I might leave you to decide. But I
      am involved in it, as your nearest relative; and, what is more, even the
      sacred memories of your father and mother might feel the slur cast on
      them.&rdquo; This exaggerated language&mdash;like all exaggerated language, a
      mischievous weapon in the arsenal of weakness and prejudice&mdash;had its
      effect on Isabel. Reluctantly and sadly, she consented to be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink wrote word of the engagement to Moody first; reserving to a
      later day the superior pleasure of informing Lady Lydiard of the very
      event which that audacious woman had declared to be impossible. To her
      aunt&rsquo;s surprise, just as she was about to close the envelope Isabel
      stepped forward, and inconsistently requested leave to add a postscript to
      the very letter which she had refused to write! Miss Pink was not even
      permitted to see the postscript. Isabel secured the envelope the moment
      she laid down her pen, and retired to her room with a headache (which was
      heartache in disguise) for the rest of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the question of marriage was still in debate, an event occurred
      which exercised a serious influence on Hardyman&rsquo;s future plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      He received a letter from the Continent which claimed his immediate
      attention. One of the sovereigns of Europe had decided on making some
      radical changes in the mounting and equipment of a cavalry regiment; and
      he required the assistance of Hardyman in that important part of the
      contemplated reform which was connected with the choice and purchase of
      horses. Setting his own interests out of the question, Hardyman owed
      obligations to the kindness of his illustrious correspondent which made it
      impossible for him to send an excuse. In a fortnight&rsquo;s time, at the
      latest, it would be necessary for him to leave England; and a month or
      more might elapse before it would be possible for him to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances, he proposed, in his own precipitate way, to
      hasten the date of the marriage. The necessary legal delay would permit
      the ceremony to be performed on that day fortnight. Isabel might then
      accompany him on his journey, and spend a brilliant honeymoon at the
      foreign Court. She at once refused, not only to accept his proposal, but
      even to take it into consideration. While Miss Pink dwelt eloquently on
      the shortness of the notice, Miss Pink&rsquo;s niece based her resolution on far
      more important grounds. Hardyman had not yet announced the contemplated
      marriage to his parents and friends; and Isabel was determined not to
      become his wife until she could be first assured of a courteous and
      tolerant reception by the family&mdash;if she could hope for no warmer
      welcome at their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman was not a man who yielded easily, even in trifles. In the present
      case, his dearest interests were concerned in inducing Isabel to
      reconsider her decision. He was still vainly trying to shake her
      resolution, when the afternoon post brought a letter for Miss Pink which
      introduced a new element of disturbance into the discussion. The letter
      was nothing less than Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s reply to the written announcement of
      Isabel&rsquo;s engagement, despatched on the previous day by Miss Pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Ladyship&rsquo;s answer was a surprisingly short one. It only contained
      these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Lydiard begs to acknowledge the receipt of Miss Pink&rsquo;s letter
      requesting that she will say nothing to Mr. Hardyman of the loss of a
      bank-note in her house, and, assigning as a reason that Miss Isabel Miller
      is engaged to be married to Mr. Hardyman, and might be prejudiced in his
      estimation if the facts were made known. Miss Pink may make her mind easy.
      Lady Lydiard had not the slightest intention of taking Mr. Hardyman into
      her confidence on the subject of her domestic affairs. With regard to the
      proposed marriage, Lady Lydiard casts no doubt on Miss Pink&rsquo;s perfect
      sincerity and good faith; but, at the same time, she positively declines
      to believe that Mr. Hardyman means to make Miss Isabel Miller his wife.
      Lady L. will yield to the evidence of a properly-attested certificate&mdash;and
      to nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A folded piece of paper, directed to Isabel, dropped out of this
      characteristic letter as Miss Pink turned from the first page to the
      second. Lady Lydiard addressed her adopted daughter in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on the point of leaving home to visit you again, when I received
      your aunt&rsquo;s letter. My poor deluded child, no words can tell how
      distressed I am about you. You are already sacrificed to the folly of the
      most foolish woman living. For God&rsquo;s sake, take care you do not fall a
      victim next to the designs of a profligate man. Come to me instantly,
      Isabel, and I promise to take care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortified by these letters, and aided by Miss Pink&rsquo;s indignation, Hardyman
      pressed his proposal on Isabel with renewed resolution. She made no
      attempt to combat his arguments&mdash;she only held firmly to her
      decision. Without some encouragement from Hardyman&rsquo;s father and mother she
      still steadily refused to become his wife. Irritated already by Lady
      Lydiard&rsquo;s letters, he lost the self-command which so eminently
      distinguished him in the ordinary affairs of life, and showed the
      domineering and despotic temper which was an inbred part of his
      disposition. Isabel&rsquo;s high spirit at once resented the harsh terms in
      which he spoke to her. In the plainest words, she released him from his
      engagement, and, without waiting for his excuses, quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left together, Hardyman and Miss Pink devised an arrangement which paid
      due respect to Isabel&rsquo;s scruples, and at the same time met Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s
      insulting assertion of disbelief in Hardyman&rsquo;s honor, by a formal and
      public announcement of the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was proposed to give a garden party at the farm in a week&rsquo;s time for
      the express purpose of introducing Isabel to Hardyman&rsquo;s family and friends
      in the character of his betrothed wife. If his father and mother accepted
      the invitation, Isabel&rsquo;s only objection to hastening the union would fall
      to the ground. Hardyman might, in that case, plead with his Imperial
      correspondent for a delay in his departure of a few days more; and the
      marriage might still take place before he left England. Isabel, at Miss
      Pink&rsquo;s intercession, was induced to accept her lover&rsquo;s excuses, and, in
      the event of her favorable reception by Hardyman&rsquo;s parents at the farm, to
      give her consent (not very willingly even yet) to hastening the ceremony
      which was to make her Hardyman&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next morning the whole of the invitations were sent out, excepting
      the invitation to Hardyman&rsquo;s father and mother. Without mentioning it to
      Isabel, Hardyman decided on personally appealing to his mother before he
      ventured on taking the head of the family into his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the interview was partially successful&mdash;and no more.
      Lord Rotherfield declined to see his youngest son; and he had engagements
      which would, under any circumstances, prevent his being present at the
      garden party. But at the express request of Lady Rotherfield, he was
      willing to make certain concessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always regarded Alfred as a barely sane person,&rdquo; said his
      Lordship, &ldquo;since he turned his back on his prospects to become a horse
      dealer. If we decline altogether to sanction this new act&mdash;I won&rsquo;t
      say, of insanity, I will say, of absurdity&mdash;on his part, it is
      impossible to predict to what discreditable extremities he may not
      proceed. We must temporise with Alfred. In the meantime I shall endeavor
      to obtain some information respecting this young person&mdash;named
      Miller, I think you said, and now resident at South Morden. If I am
      satisfied that she is a woman of reputable character, possessing an
      average education and presentable manners, we may as well let Alfred take
      his own way. He is out of the pale of Society, as it is; and Miss Miller
      has no father and mother to complicate matters, which is distinctly a
      merit on her part and, in short, if the marriage is not absolutely
      disgraceful, the wisest way (as we have no power to prevent it) will be to
      submit. You will say nothing to Alfred about what I propose to do. I tell
      you plainly I don&rsquo;t trust him. You will simply inform him from me that I
      want time to consider, and that, unless he hears to the contrary in the
      interval, he may expect to have the sanction of your presence at his
      breakfast, or luncheon, or whatever it is. I must go to town in a day or
      two, and I shall ascertain what Alfred&rsquo;s friends know about this last of
      his many follies, if I meet any of them at the club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Returning to South Morden in no serene frame of mind, Hardyman found
      Isabel in a state of depression which perplexed and alarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news that his mother might be expected to be present at the garden
      party failed entirely to raise her spirits. The only explanation she gave
      of the change in her was, that the dull heavy weather of the last few days
      made her feel a little languid and nervous. Naturally dissatisfied with
      this reply to his inquiries, Hardyman asked for Miss Pink. He was informed
      that Miss Pink could not see him. She was constitutionally subject to
      asthma, and, having warnings of the return of the malady, she was (by the
      doctor&rsquo;s advice) keeping her room. Hardyman returned to the farm in a
      temper which was felt by everybody in his employment, from the trainer to
      the stable-boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the apology made for Miss Pink stated no more than the plain truth,
      it must be confessed that Hardyman was right in declining to be satisfied
      with Isabel&rsquo;s excuse for the melancholy that oppressed her. She had that
      morning received Moody&rsquo;s answer to the lines which she had addressed to
      him at the end of her aunt&rsquo;s letter; and she had not yet recovered from
      the effect which it had produced on her spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible for me to say honestly that I am not distressed (Moody
      wrote) by the news of your marriage engagement. The blow has fallen very
      heavily on me. When I look at the future now, I see only a dreary blank.
      This is not your fault&mdash;you are in no way to blame. I remember the
      time when I should have been too angry to own this&mdash;when I might have
      said or done things which I should have bitterly repented afterwards. That
      time is past. My temper has been softened, since I have befriended you in
      your troubles. That good at least has come out of my foolish hopes, and
      perhaps out of the true sympathy which I have felt for you. I can honestly
      ask you to accept my heart&rsquo;s dearest wishes for your happiness&mdash;and I
      can keep the rest to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me say a word now relating to the efforts that I have made to help
      you, since that sad day when you left Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped (for reasons which it is needless to mention here) to
      interest Mr. Hardyman himself in aiding our inquiry. But your aunt&rsquo;s
      wishes, as expressed in her letter to me, close my lips. I will only beg
      you, at some convenient time, to let me mention the last discoveries that
      we have made; leaving it to your discretion, when Mr. Hardyman has become
      your husband, to ask him the questions which, under other circumstances, I
      should have put to him myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, of course, possible that the view I take of Mr. Hardyman&rsquo;s
      capacity to help us may be a mistaken one. In this case, if you still wish
      the investigation to be privately carried on, I entreat you to let me
      continue to direct it, as the greatest favor you can confer on your
      devoted old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need be under no apprehension about the expense to which you are
      likely to put me. I have unexpectedly inherited what is to me a handsome
      fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same post which brought your aunt&rsquo;s letter brought a line from a
      lawyer asking me to see him on the subject of my late father&rsquo;s affairs. I
      waited a day or two before I could summon heart enough to see him, or to
      see anybody; and then I went to his office. You have heard that my
      father&rsquo;s bank stopped payment, at a time of commercial panic. His failure
      was mainly attributable to the treachery of a friend to whom he had lent a
      large sum of money, and who paid him the yearly interest, without
      acknowledging that every farthing of it had been lost in unsuccessful
      speculations. The son of this man has prospered in business, and he has
      honorably devoted a part of his wealth to the payment of his father&rsquo;s
      creditors. Half the sum due to <i>my</i> father has thus passed into my
      hands as his next of kin; and the other half is to follow in course of
      time. If my hopes had been fulfilled, how gladly I should have shared my
      prosperity with you! As it is, I have far more than enough for my wants as
      a lonely man, and plenty left to spend in your service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless and prosper you, my dear. I shall ask you to accept a little
      present from me, among the other offerings that are made to you before the
      wedding day.&mdash;R.M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The studiously considerate and delicate tone in which these lines were
      written had an effect on Isabel which was exactly the opposite of the
      effect intended by the writer. She burst into a passionate fit of tears;
      and in the safe solitude of her own room, the despairing words escaped
      her, &ldquo;I wish I had died before I met with Alfred Hardyman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the days wore on, disappointments and difficulties seemed by a kind of
      fatality to beset the contemplated announcement of the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pink&rsquo;s asthma, developed by the unfavorable weather, set the doctor&rsquo;s
      art at defiance, and threatened to keep that unfortunate lady a prisoner
      in her room on the day of the party. Hardyman&rsquo;s invitations were in some
      cases refused; and in others accepted by husbands with excuses for the
      absence of their wives. His elder brother made an apology for himself as
      well as for his wife. Felix Sweetsir wrote, &ldquo;With pleasure, dear Alfred,
      if my health permits me to leave the house.&rdquo; Lady Lydiard, invited at Miss
      Pink&rsquo;s special request, sent no reply. The one encouraging circumstance
      was the silence of Lady Rotherfield. So long as her son received no
      intimation to the contrary, it was a sign that Lord Rotherfield permitted
      his wife to sanction the marriage by her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman wrote to his Imperial correspondent, engaging to leave England on
      the earliest possible day, and asking to be pardoned if he failed to
      express himself more definitely, in consideration of domestic affairs,
      which it was necessary to settle before he started for the Continent. If
      there should not be time enough to write again, he promised to send a
      telegraphic announcement of his departure. Long afterwards, Hardyman
      remembered the misgivings that had troubled him when he wrote that letter.
      In the rough draught of it, he had mentioned, as his excuse for not being
      yet certain of his own movements, that he expected to be immediately
      married. In the fair copy, the vague foreboding of some accident to come
      was so painfully present to his mind, that he struck out the words which
      referred to his marriage, and substituted the designedly indefinite
      phrase, &ldquo;domestic affairs.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE day of the garden party arrived. There was no rain; but the air was
      heavy, and the sky was overcast by lowering clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours before the guests were expected, Isabel arrived alone at the
      farm, bearing the apologies of unfortunate Miss Pink, still kept a
      prisoner in her bed-chamber by the asthma. In the confusion produced at
      the cottage by the preparations for entertaining the company, the one room
      in which Hardyman could receive Isabel with the certainty of not being
      interrupted was the smoking-room. To this haven of refuge he led her&mdash;still
      reserved and silent, still not restored to her customary spirits. &ldquo;If any
      visitors come before the time,&rdquo; Hardyman said to his servant, &ldquo;tell them I
      am engaged at the stables. I must have an hour&rsquo;s quiet talk with you,&rdquo; he
      continued, turning to Isabel, &ldquo;or I shall be in too bad a temper to
      receive my guests with common politeness. The worry of giving this party
      is not to be told in words. I almost wish I had been content with
      presenting you to my mother, and had let the rest of my acquaintances go
      to the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quiet half hour passed; and the first visitor, a stranger to the
      servants, appeared at the cottage-gate. He was a middle-aged man, and he
      had no wish to disturb Mr. Hardyman. &ldquo;I will wait in the grounds,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;and trouble nobody.&rdquo; The middle-aged man, who expressed himself in
      these modest terms, was Robert Moody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later, a carriage drove up to the gate. An elderly lady got
      out of it, followed by a fat white Scotch terrier, who growled at every
      stranger within his reach. It is needless to introduce Lady Lydiard and
      Tommie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Informed that Mr. Hardyman was at the stables, Lady Lydiard gave the
      servant her card. &ldquo;Take that to your master, and say I won&rsquo;t detain him
      five minutes.&rdquo; With these words, her Ladyship sauntered into the grounds.
      She looked about her with observant eyes; not only noticing the tent which
      had been set up on the grass to accommodate the expected guests, but
      entering it, and looking at the waiters who were engaged in placing the
      luncheon on the table. Returning to the outer world, she next remarked
      that Mr. Hardyman&rsquo;s lawn was in very bad order. Barren sun-dried patches,
      and little holes and crevices opened here and there by the action of the
      summer heat, announced that the lawn, like everything else at the farm,
      had been neglected, in the exclusive attention paid to the claims of the
      horses. Reaching a shrubbery which bounded one side of the grounds next,
      her Ladyship became aware of a man slowly approaching her, to all
      appearance absorbed in thought. The man drew a little nearer. She lifted
      her glasses to her eyes and recognized&mdash;Moody.
    </p>
    <p>
      No embarrassment was produced on either side by this unexpected meeting.
      Lady Lydiard had, not long since, sent to ask her former steward to visit
      her; regretting, in her warm-hearted way, the terms on which they had
      separated, and wishing to atone for the harsh language that had escaped
      her at their parting interview. In the friendly talk which followed the
      reconciliation, Lady Lydiard not only heard the news of Moody&rsquo;s pecuniary
      inheritance&mdash;but, noticing the change in his appearance for the
      worse, contrived to extract from him the confession of his ill-starred
      passion for Isabel. To discover him now, after all that he had
      acknowledged, walking about the grounds at Hardyman&rsquo;s farm, took her
      Ladyship completely by surprise. &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in her
      loudest tones, &ldquo;what are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mentioned Mr. Hardyman&rsquo;s garden party, my Lady, when I had the honor
      of waiting on you,&rdquo; Moody answered. &ldquo;Thinking over it afterward, it seemed
      the fittest occasion I could find for making a little wedding present to
      Miss Isabel. Is there any harm in my asking Mr. Hardyman to let me put the
      present on her plate, so that she may see it when she sits down to
      luncheon? If your Ladyship thinks so, I will go away directly, and send
      the gift by post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard looked at him attentively. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t despise the girl,&rdquo; she
      asked, &ldquo;for selling herself for rank and money? I do&mdash;I can tell
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody&rsquo;s worn white face flushed a little. &ldquo;No, my Lady,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t hear you say that! Isabel would not have engaged herself to Mr.
      Hardyman unless she had been fond of him&mdash;as fond, I dare say, as I
      once hoped she might be of me. It&rsquo;s a hard thing to confess that; but I do
      confess it, in justice to her&mdash;God bless her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The generosity that spoke in those simple words touched the finest
      sympathies in Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s nature. &ldquo;Give me your hand,&rdquo; she said, with
      her own generous spirit kindling in her eyes. &ldquo;You have a great heart,
      Moody. Isabel Miller is a fool for not marrying <i>you</i>&mdash;and one
      day she will know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before a word more could pass between them, Hardyman&rsquo;s voice was audible
      on the other side of the shrubbery, calling irritably to his servant to
      find Lady Lydiard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moody retired to the further end of the walk, while Lady Lydiard advanced
      in the opposite direction, so as to meet Hardyman at the entrance to the
      shrubbery. He bowed stiffly, and begged to know why her Ladyship had
      honored him with a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard replied without noticing the coldness of her reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been very well, Mr. Hardyman, or you would have seen me before
      this. My only object in presenting myself here is to make my excuses
      personally for having written of you in terms which expressed a doubt of
      your honor. I have done you an injustice, and I beg you to forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman acknowledged this frank apology as unreservedly as it had been
      offered to him. &ldquo;Say no more, Lady Lydiard. And let me hope, now you are
      here, that you will honor my little party with your presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lydiard gravely stated her reasons for not accepting the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I disapprove so strongly of unequal marriages,&rdquo; she said, walking on
      slowly towards the cottage, &ldquo;that I cannot, in common consistency, become
      one of your guests. I shall always feel interested in Isabel Miller&rsquo;s
      welfare; and I can honestly say I shall be glad if your married life
      proves that my old-fashioned prejudices are without justification in your
      case. Accept my thanks for your invitation; and let me hope that my plain
      speaking has not offended you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bowed, and looked about her for Tommie before she advanced to the
      carriage waiting for her at the gate. In the surprise of seeing Moody she
      had forgotten to look back for the dog when she entered the shrubbery. She
      now called to him, and blew the whistle at her watch-chain. Not a sign of
      Tommie was to be seen. Hardyman instantly directed the servants to search
      in the cottage and out of the cottage for the dog. The order was obeyed
      with all needful activity and intelligence, and entirely without success.
      For the time being at any rate, Tommie was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman promised to have the dog looked for in every part of the farm,
      and to send him back in the care of one of his own men. With these polite
      assurances Lady Lydiard was obliged to be satisfied. She drove away in a
      very despondent frame of mind. &ldquo;First Isabel, and now Tommie,&rdquo; thought her
      Ladyship. &ldquo;I am losing the only companions who made life tolerable to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Returning from the garden gate, after taking leave of his visitor,
      Hardyman received from his servant a handful of letters which had just
      arrived for him. Walking slowly over the lawn as he opened them, he found
      nothing but excuses for the absence of guests who had already accepted
      their invitations. He had just thrust the letters into his pocket, when he
      heard footsteps behind him, and, looking round, found himself confronted
      by Moody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo! have you come to lunch?&rdquo; Hardyman asked, roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come here, sir, with a little gift for Miss Isabel, in honor of
      her marriage,&rdquo; Moody answered quietly, &ldquo;and I ask your permission to put
      it on the table, so that she may see it when your guests sit down to
      luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened a jeweler&rsquo;s case as he spoke, containing a plain gold bracelet
      with an inscription engraved on the inner side: &ldquo;To Miss Isabel Miller,
      with the sincere good wishes of Robert Moody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plain as it was, the design of the bracelet was unusually beautiful.
      Hardyman had noticed Moody&rsquo;s agitation on the day when he had met Isabel
      near her aunt&rsquo;s house, and had drawn his own conclusions from it. His face
      darkened with a momentary jealousy as he looked at the bracelet. &ldquo;All
      right, old fellow!&rdquo; he said, with contemptuous familiarity. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
      modest. Wait and give it to her with your own hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Moody &ldquo;I would rather leave it, if you please, to speak
      for itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman understood the delicacy of feeling which dictated those words,
      and, without well knowing why, resented it. He was on the point of
      speaking, under the influence of this unworthy motive, when Isabel&rsquo;s voice
      reached his ears, calling to him from the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moody&rsquo;s face contracted with a sudden expression of pain as he, too,
      recognized the voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me detain you, sir,&rdquo; he said, sadly.
      &ldquo;Good-morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman left him without ceremony. Moody, slowly following, entered the
      tent. All the preparations for the luncheon had been completed; nobody was
      there. The places to be occupied by the guests were indicated by cards
      bearing their names. Moody found Isabel&rsquo;s card, and put his bracelet
      inside the folded napkin on her plate. For a while he stood with his hand
      on the table, thinking. The temptation to communicate once more with
      Isabel before he lost her forever, was fast getting the better of his
      powers of resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could persuade her to write a word to say she liked her bracelet,&rdquo;
       he thought, &ldquo;it would be a comfort when I go back to my solitary life.&rdquo; He
      tore a leaf out of his pocket book and wrote on it, &ldquo;One line to say you
      accept my gift and my good wishes. Put it under the cushion of your chair,
      and I shall find it when the company have left the tent.&rdquo; He slipped the
      paper into the case which held the bracelet, and instead of leaving the
      farm as he had intended, turned back to the shelter of the shrubbery.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      HARDYMAN went on to the cottage. He found Isabel in some agitation. And
      there, by her side, with his tail wagging slowly, and his eye on Hardyman
      in expectation of a possible kick&mdash;there was the lost Tommie!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Lady Lydiard gone?&rdquo; Isabel asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hardyman. &ldquo;Where did you find the dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As events had ordered it, the dog had found Isabel, under these
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s card in the smoking-room had been an
      alarming event for Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s adopted daughter. She was guiltily
      conscious of not having answered her Ladyship&rsquo;s note, inclosed in Miss
      Pink&rsquo;s letter, and of not having taken her Ladyship&rsquo;s advice in regulating
      her conduct towards Hardyman. As he rose to leave the room and receive his
      visitor in the grounds, Isabel begged him to say nothing of her presence
      at the farm, unless Lady Lydiard exhibited a forgiving turn of mind by
      asking to see her. Left by herself in the smoking-room, she suddenly heard
      a bark in the passage which had a familiar sound in her ears. She opened
      the door&mdash;and in rushed Tommie, with one of his shrieks of delight!
      Curiosity had taken him into the house. He had heard the voices in the
      smoking-room; had recognized Isabel&rsquo;s voice; and had waited, with his
      customary cunning and his customary distrust of strangers, until Hardyman
      was out of the way. Isabel kissed and caressed him, and then drove him out
      again to the lawn, fearing that Lady Lydiard might return to look for him.
      Going back to the smoking-room, she stood at the window watching for
      Hardyman&rsquo;s return. When the servants came to look for the dog, she could
      only tell them that she had last seen him in the grounds, not far from the
      cottage. The useless search being abandoned, and the carriage having left
      the gate, who should crawl out from the back of a cupboard in which some
      empty hampers were placed but Tommie himself! How he had contrived to get
      back to the smoking-room (unless she had omitted to completely close the
      door on her return) it was impossible to say. But there he was, determined
      this time to stay with Isabel, and keeping in his hiding place until he
      heard the movement of the carriage-wheels, which informed him that his
      lawful mistress had left the cottage! Isabel had at once called Hardyman,
      on the chance that the carriage might yet be stopped. It was already out
      of sight, and nobody knew which of two roads it had taken, both leading to
      London. In this emergency, Isabel could only look at Hardyman and ask what
      was to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t spare a servant till after the party,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The dog must
      be tied up in the stables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel shook her head. Tommie was not accustomed to be tied up. He would
      make a disturbance, and he would be beaten by the grooms. &ldquo;I will take
      care of him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else to think of besides the dog,&rdquo; Hardyman rejoined
      irritably. &ldquo;Look at these letters!&rdquo; He pulled them out of his pocket as he
      spoke. &ldquo;Here are no less than seven men, all calling themselves my
      friends, who accepted my invitation, and who write to excuse themselves on
      the very day of the party. Do you know why? They&rsquo;re all afraid of my
      father&mdash;I forgot to tell you he&rsquo;s a Cabinet Minister as well as a
      Lord. Cowards and cads. They have heard he isn&rsquo;t coming and they think to
      curry favor with the great man by stopping away. Come along, Isabel! Let&rsquo;s
      take their names off the luncheon table. Not a man of them shall ever
      darken my doors again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to blame for what has happened,&rdquo; Isabel answered sadly. &ldquo;I am
      estranging you from your friends. There is still time, Alfred, to alter
      your mind and let me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his arm round her with rough fondness. &ldquo;I would sacrifice every
      friend I have in the world rather than lose you. Come along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They left the cottage. At the entrance to the tent, Hardyman noticed the
      dog at Isabel&rsquo;s heels, and vented his ill-temper, as usual with male
      humanity, on the nearest unoffending creature that he could find. &ldquo;Be off,
      you mongrel brute!&rdquo; he shouted. The tail of Tommie relaxed from its
      customary tight curve over the small of his back; and the legs of Tommie
      (with his tail between them) took him at full gallop to the friendly
      shelter of the cupboard in the smoking-room. It was one of those trifling
      circumstances which women notice seriously. Isabel said nothing; she only
      thought to herself, &ldquo;I wish he had shown his temper when I first knew
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read the names,&rdquo; said Hardyman, &ldquo;and you find the cards and tear
      them up. Stop! I&rsquo;ll keep the cards. You&rsquo;re just the sort of woman my
      father likes. He&rsquo;ll be reconciled to me when he sees you, after we are
      married. If one of those men ever asks him for a place, I&rsquo;ll take care, if
      it&rsquo;s years hence, to put an obstacle in his way! Here; take my pencil, and
      make a mark on the cards to remind me; the same mark I set against a horse
      in my book when I don&rsquo;t like him&mdash;a cross, inclosed in a circle.&rdquo; He
      produced his pocketbook. His hands trembled with anger as he gave the
      pencil to Isabel and laid the book on the table. He had just read the name
      of the first false friend, and Isabel had just found the card, when a
      servant appeared with a message. &ldquo;Mrs. Drumblade has arrived, sir, and
      wishes to see you on a matter of the greatest importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman left the tent, not very willingly. &ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; he said to
      Isabel; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing near her own place at the table. Moody had left one end
      of the jeweler&rsquo;s case visible above the napkin, to attract her attention.
      In a minute more the bracelet and note were in her hands. She dropped on
      her chair, overwhelmed by the conflicting emotions that rose in her at the
      sight of the bracelet, at the reading of the note. Her head drooped, and
      the tears filled her eyes. &ldquo;Are all women as blind as I have been to what
      is good and noble in the men who love them?&rdquo; she wondered, sadly. &ldquo;Better
      as it is,&rdquo; she thought, with a bitter sigh; &ldquo;I am not worthy of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she took up the pencil to write her answer to Moody on the back of her
      dinner-card, the servant appeared again at the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master wants you at the cottage, miss, immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel rose, putting the bracelet and the note in the silver-mounted
      leather pocket (a present from Hardyman) which hung at her belt. In the
      hurry of passing round the table to get out, she never noticed that her
      dress touched Hardyman&rsquo;s pocketbook, placed close to the edge, and threw
      it down on the grass below. The book fell into one of the heat cracks
      which Lady Lydiard had noticed as evidence of the neglected condition of
      the cottage lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to hear the pleasant news my sister has just brought me,&rdquo; said
      Hardyman, when Isabel joined him in the parlor. &ldquo;Mrs. Drumblade has been
      told, on the best authority, that my mother is not coming to the party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be some reason, of course, dear Isabel,&rdquo; added Mrs. Drumblade.
      &ldquo;Have you any idea of what it can be? I haven&rsquo;t seen my mother myself; and
      all my inquiries have failed to find it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked searchingly at Isabel as she spoke. The mask of sympathy on her
      face was admirably worn. Nobody who possessed only a superficial
      acquaintance with Mrs. Drumblade&rsquo;s character would have suspected how
      thoroughly she was enjoying in secret the position of embarrassment in
      which her news had placed her brother. Instinctively doubting whether Mrs.
      Drumblade&rsquo;s friendly behavior was quite as sincere as it appeared to be,
      Isabel answered that she was a stranger to Lady Rotherfield, and was
      therefore quite at a loss to explain the cause of her ladyship&rsquo;s absence.
      As she spoke, the guests began to arrive in quick succession, and the
      subject was dropped as a matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a merry party. Hardyman&rsquo;s approaching marriage had been made
      the topic of much malicious gossip, and Isabel&rsquo;s character had, as usual
      in such cases, become the object of all the false reports that scandal
      could invent. Lady Rotherfield&rsquo;s absence confirmed the general conviction
      that Hardyman was disgracing himself. The men were all more or less
      uneasy. The women resented the discovery that Isabel was&mdash;personally
      speaking, at least&mdash;beyond the reach of hostile criticism. Her beauty
      was viewed as a downright offense; her refined and modest manners were set
      down as perfect acting; &ldquo;really disgusting, my dear, in so young a girl.&rdquo;
       General Drumblade, a large and mouldy veteran, in a state of chronic
      astonishment (after his own matrimonial experience) at Hardyman&rsquo;s folly in
      marrying at all, diffused a wide circle of gloom, wherever he went and
      whatever he did. His accomplished wife, forcing her high spirits on
      everybody&rsquo;s attention with a sort of kittenish playfulness, intensified
      the depressing effect of the general dullness by all the force of the
      strongest contrast. After waiting half an hour for his mother, and waiting
      in vain, Hardyman led the way to the tent in despair. &ldquo;The sooner I fill
      their stomachs and get rid of them,&rdquo; he thought savagely, &ldquo;the better I
      shall be pleased!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The luncheon was attacked by the company with a certain silent ferocity,
      which the waiters noticed as remarkable, even in their large experience.
      The men drank deeply, but with wonderfully little effect in raising their
      spirits; the women, with the exception of amiable Mrs. Drumblade, kept
      Isabel deliberately out of the conversation that went on among them.
      General Drumblade, sitting next to her in one of the places of honor,
      discoursed to Isabel privately on &ldquo;my brother-in-law Hardyman&rsquo;s infernal
      temper.&rdquo; A young marquis, on her other side&mdash;a mere lad, chosen to
      make the necessary speech in acknowledgment of his superior rank&mdash;rose,
      in a state of nervous trepidation, to propose Isabel&rsquo;s health as the
      chosen bride of their host. Pale and trembling, conscious of having
      forgotten the words which he had learnt beforehand, this unhappy young
      nobleman began: &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, I haven&rsquo;t an idea&mdash;&rdquo; He
      stopped, put his hand to his head, stared wildly, and sat down again;
      having contrived to state his own case with masterly brevity and perfect
      truth, in a speech of seven words.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the dismay, in some cases, and the amusement in others, was still at
      its height, Hardyman&rsquo;s valet made his appearance, and, approaching his
      master, said in a whisper, &ldquo;Could I speak to you, sit, for a moment
      outside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do you want?&rdquo; Hardyman asked irritably. &ldquo;Is that a letter
      in your hand? Give it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The valet was a Frenchman. In other words, he had a sense of what was due
      to himself. His master had forgotten this. He gave up the letter with a
      certain dignity of manner, and left the tent. Hardyman opened the letter.
      He turned pale as he read it; crumpled it in his hand, and threw it down
      on the table. &ldquo;By G&mdash;d! it&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; he exclaimed furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests rose in confusion. Mrs. Drumblade, finding the letter within
      her reach, coolly possessed herself of it; recognized her mother&rsquo;s
      handwriting; and read these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only now succeeded in persuading your father to let me write to
      you. For God&rsquo;s sake, break off your marriage at any sacrifice. Your father
      has heard, on unanswerable authority, that Miss Isabel Miller left her
      situation in Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house on suspicion of theft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While his sister was reading this letter, Hardyman had made his way to
      Isabel&rsquo;s chair. &ldquo;I must speak to you, directly,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Come away
      with me!&rdquo; He turned, as he took her arm, and looked at the table. &ldquo;Where
      is my letter?&rdquo; he asked. Mrs. Drumblade handed it to him, dexterously
      crumpled up again as she had found it. &ldquo;No bad news, dear Alfred, I hope?&rdquo;
       she said, in her most affectionate manner. Hardyman snatched the letter
      from her, without answering, and led Isabel out of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that!&rdquo; he said, when they were alone. &ldquo;And tell me at once whether
      it&rsquo;s true or false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel read the letter. For a moment the shock of the discovery held her
      speechless. She recovered herself, and returned the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman staggered back as if she had shot him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True that you are guilty?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am innocent. Everybody who knows me believes in my innocence. It is
      true the appearances were against me. They are against me still.&rdquo; Having
      said this, she waited, quietly and firmly, for his next words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed his hand over his forehead with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad
      enough as it is,&rdquo; he said, speaking quietly on his side. &ldquo;But the remedy
      for it is plain enough. Come back to the tent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She never moved. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose I don&rsquo;t believe in your innocence too?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The
      one way of setting you right with the world now is for me to make you my
      wife, in spite of the appearances that point to you. I&rsquo;m too fond of you,
      Isabel, to give you up. Come back with me, and I will announce our
      marriage to my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took his hand, and kissed it. &ldquo;It is generous and good of you,&rdquo; she
      said; &ldquo;but it must not be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a step nearer to her. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was against my will,&rdquo; she pursued, &ldquo;that my aunt concealed the truth
      from you. I did wrong to consent to it, I will do wrong no more. Your
      mother is right, Alfred. After what has happened, I am not fit to be your
      wife until my innocence is proved. It is not proved yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The angry color began to rise in his face once more. &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;I am not in a humor to be trifled with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not trifling with you,&rdquo; she answered, in low, sad tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really mean what you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be obstinate, Isabel. Take time to consider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, Alfred. My duty is plain to me. I will marry you&mdash;if
      you still wish it&mdash;when my good name is restored to me. Not before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid one hand on her arm, and pointed with the other to the guests in
      the distance, all leaving the tent on the way to their carriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your good name will be restored to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on the day when I
      make you my wife. The worst enemy you have cannot associate <i>my</i> name
      with a suspicion of theft. Remember that and think a little before you
      decide. You see those people there. If you don&rsquo;t change your mind by the
      time they have got to the cottage, it&rsquo;s good-by between us, and good-by
      forever. I refuse to wait for you; I refuse to accept a conditional
      engagement. Wait, and think. They&rsquo;re walking slowly; you have got some
      minutes more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still held her arm, watching the guests as they gradually receded from
      view. It was not until they had all collected in a group outside the
      cottage door that he spoke himself, or that he permitted Isabel to speak
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have had your time to get cool. Will you take my arm,
      and join those people with me? or will you say good-by forever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Alfred!&rdquo; she began, gently. &ldquo;I cannot consent, in justice to
      you, to shelter myself behind your name. It is the name of your family;
      and they have a right to expect that you will not degrade it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a plain answer,&rdquo; he interposed sternly. &ldquo;Which is it? Yes, or No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with sad compassionate eyes. Her voice was firm as she
      answered him in one word as he had desired. The word was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without speaking to her, without even looking at her, he turned and walked
      back to the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making his way silently through the group of visitors&mdash;every one of
      whom had been informed of what had happened by his sister&mdash;with his
      head down and his lips fast closed, he entered the parlor and rang the
      bell which communicated with his foreman&rsquo;s rooms at the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I am going abroad on business?&rdquo; he said, when the man
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to-day&mdash;going by the night train to Dover. Order the
      horse to be put to instantly in the dogcart. Is there anything wanted
      before I am off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inexorable necessities of business asserted their claims through the
      obedient medium of the foreman. Chafing at the delay, Hardyman was obliged
      to sit at his desk, signing checks and passing accounts, with the dogcart
      waiting in the stable yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock at the door startled him in the middle of his work. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he
      called out sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up, expecting to see one of the guests or one of the servants.
      It was Moody who entered the room. Hardyman laid down his pen, and fixed
      his eyes sternly on the man who had dared to interrupt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do <i>you</i> want?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen Miss Isabel, and spoken with her,&rdquo; Moody replied. &ldquo;Mr.
      Hardyman, I believe it is in your power to set this matter right. For the
      young lady&rsquo;s sake, sir, you must not leave England without doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman turned to his foreman. &ldquo;Is this fellow mad or drunk?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moody proceeded as calmly and as resolutely as if those words had not been
      spoken. &ldquo;I apologize for my intrusion, sir. I will trouble you with no
      explanations. I will only ask one question. Have you a memorandum of the
      number of that five-hundred pound note you paid away in France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardyman lost all control over himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scoundrel!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;have you been prying into my private affairs?
      Is it <i>your</i> business to know what I did in France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it <i>your</i> vengeance on a woman to refuse to tell her the number
      of a bank-note?&rdquo; Moody rejoined, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That answer forced its way, through Hardyman&rsquo;s anger, to Hardyman&rsquo;s sense
      of honor. He rose and advanced to Moody. For a moment the two men faced
      each other in silence. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bold fellow,&rdquo; said Hardyman, with a
      sudden change from anger to irony. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the lady justice. I&rsquo;ll look at
      my pocketbook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand into the breast-pocket of his coat; he searched his other
      pockets; he turned over the objects on his writing-table. The book was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moody watched him with a feeling of despair. &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Hardyman, don&rsquo;t say
      you have lost your pocketbook!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down again at his desk, with sullen submission to the new disaster.
      &ldquo;All I can say is you&rsquo;re at liberty to look for it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I must
      have dropped it somewhere.&rdquo; He turned impatiently to the foreman, &ldquo;Now
      then! What is the next check wanted? I shall go mad if I wait in this
      damned place much longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody left him, and found his way to the servants&rsquo; offices. &ldquo;Mr. Hardyman
      has lost his pocketbook,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look for it, indoors and out&mdash;on
      the lawn, and in the tent. Ten pounds reward for the man who finds it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Servants and waiters instantly dispersed, eager for the promised reward.
      The men who pursued the search outside the cottage divided their forces.
      Some of them examined the lawn and the flower-beds. Others went straight
      to the empty tent. These last were too completely absorbed in pursuing the
      object in view to notice that they disturbed a dog, eating a stolen lunch
      of his own from the morsels left on the plates. The dog slunk away under
      the canvas when the men came in, waited in hiding until they had gone,
      then returned to the tent, and went on with his luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moody hastened back to the part of the grounds (close to the shrubbery) in
      which Isabel was waiting his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, while he was telling her of his interview with
      Hardyman, with an expression in her eyes which he had never seen in them
      before&mdash;an expression which set his heart beating wildly, and made
      him break off in his narrative before he had reached the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she said quietly, as he stopped in confusion. &ldquo;You have
      made one more sacrifice to my welfare. Robert! I believe you are the
      noblest man that ever breathed the breath of life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes sank before hers; he blushed like a boy. &ldquo;I have done nothing for
      you yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t despair of the future, if the pocketbook should
      not be found. I know who the man is who received the bank note; and I have
      only to find him to decide the question whether it <i>is</i> the stolen
      note or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled sadly as his enthusiasm. &ldquo;Are you going back to Mr. Sharon to
      help you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;That trick he played me has destroyed <i>my</i>
      belief in him. He no more knows than I do who the thief really is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, Isabel. He knows&mdash;and I know.&rdquo; He stopped there,
      and made a sign to her to be silent. One of the servants was approaching
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the pocketbook found?&rdquo; Moody asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Hardyman left the cottage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has just gone, sir. Have you any further instructions to give us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. There is my address in London, if the pocketbook should be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man took the card that was handed to him and retired. Moody offered
      his arm to Isabel. &ldquo;I am at your service,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you wish to
      return to your aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had advanced nearly as far as the tent, on their way out of the
      grounds, when they were met by a gentleman walking towards them from the
      cottage. He was a stranger to Isabel. Moody immediately recognized him as
      Mr. Felix Sweetsir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! our good Moody!&rdquo; cried Felix. &ldquo;Enviable man! you look younger than
      ever.&rdquo; He took off his hat to Isabel; his bright restless eyes suddenly
      became quiet as they rested on her. &ldquo;Have I the honor of addressing the
      future Mrs. Hardyman? May I offer my best congratulations? What has become
      of our friend Alfred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody answered for Isabel. &ldquo;If you will make inquiries at the cottage,
      sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will find that you are mistaken, to say the least of
      it, in addressing your questions to this young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix took off his hat again&mdash;with the most becoming appearance of
      surprise and distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something wrong, I fear?&rdquo; he said, addressing Isabel. &ldquo;I am, indeed,
      ashamed if I have ignorantly given you a moment&rsquo;s pain. Pray accept my
      most sincere apologies. I have only this instant arrived; my health would
      not allow me to be present at the luncheon. Permit me to express the
      earnest hope that matters may be set right to the satisfaction of all
      parties. Good-afternoon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed with elaborate courtesy, and turned back to the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; Isabel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s nephew, Mr. Felix Sweetsir,&rdquo; Moody answered, with a sudden
      sternness of tone, and a sudden coldness of manner, which surprised
      Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like him?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, Felix stopped to give audience to one of the grooms, who
      had apparently been sent with a message to him. He turned so that his face
      was once more visible to Isabel. Moody pressed her hand significantly as
      it rested on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look well at that man,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to warn you. Mr. Felix
      Sweetsir is the worst enemy you have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel heard him in speechless astonishment. He went on in tones that
      trembled with suppressed emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You doubt if Sharon knows the thief. You doubt if I know the thief.
      Isabel! as certainly as the heaven is above us, there stands the wretch
      who stole the bank-note!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her hand out of his arm with a cry of terror. She looked at him
      as if she doubted whether he was in his right mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand, and waited a moment trying to compose himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At the first consultation I had with Sharon he
      gave this advice to Mr. Troy and to me. He said, &lsquo;Suspect the very last
      person on whom suspicion could possibly fall.&rsquo; Those words, taken with the
      questions he had asked before he pronounced his opinion, struck through me
      as if he had struck me with a knife. I instantly suspected Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s
      nephew. Wait! From that time to this I have said nothing of my suspicion
      to any living soul. I knew in my own heart that it took its rise in the
      inveterate dislike that I have always felt for Mr. Sweetsir, and I
      distrusted it accordingly. But I went back to Sharon, for all that, and
      put the case into his hands. His investigations informed me that Mr.
      Sweetsir owed &lsquo;debts of honor&rsquo; (as gentlemen call them), incurred through
      lost bets, to a large number of persons, and among them a bet of five
      hundred pounds lost to Mr. Hardyman. Further inquiries showed that Mr.
      Hardyman had taken the lead in declaring that he would post Mr. Sweetsir
      as a defaulter, and have him turned out of his clubs, and turned out of
      the betting-ring. Ruin stared him in the face if he failed to pay his debt
      to Mr. Hardyman on the last day left to him&mdash;the day after the note
      was lost. On that very morning, Lady Lydiard, speaking to me of her
      nephew&rsquo;s visit to her, said, &lsquo;If I had given him an opportunity of
      speaking, Felix would have borrowed money of me; I saw it in his face.&rsquo; 
      One moment more, Isabel. I am not only certain that Mr. Sweetsir took the
      five-hundred pound note out of the open letter, I am firmly persuaded that
      he is the man who told Lord Rotherfield of the circumstances under which
      you left Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house. Your marriage to Mr. Hardyman might have
      put you in a position to detect the theft. You, not I, might, in that
      case, have discovered from your husband that the stolen note was the note
      with which Mr. Sweetsir paid his debt. He came here, you may depend on it,
      to make sure that he had succeeded in destroying your prospects. A more
      depraved villain at heart than that man never swung from a gallows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He checked himself at those words. The shock of the disclosure, the
      passion and vehemence with which he spoke, overwhelmed Isabel. She
      trembled like a frightened child.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was still trying to soothe and reassure her, a low whining made
      itself heard at her feet. They looked down, and saw Tommie. Finding
      himself noticed at last, he expressed his sense of relief by a bark.
      Something dropped out of his mouth. As Moody stooped to pick it up, the
      dog ran to Isabel and pushed his head against her feet, as his way was
      when he expected to have the handkerchief thrown over him, preparatory to
      one of those games at hide-and-seek which have been already mentioned.
      Isabel put out her hand to caress him, when she was stopped by a cry from
      Moody. It was <i>his</i> turn to tremble now. His voice faltered as he
      said the words, &ldquo;The dog has found the pocketbook!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the book with shaking hands. A betting-book was bound up in it,
      with the customary calendar. He turned to the date of the day after the
      robbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the entry: &ldquo;Felix Sweetsir. Paid 500 pounds. Note numbered, N 8,
      70564; dated 15th May, 1875.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moody took from his waistcoat pocket his own memorandum of the number of
      the lost bank-note. &ldquo;Read it Isabel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t trust my memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read it. The number and date of the note entered in the pocketbook
      exactly corresponded with the number and date of the note that Lady
      Lydiard had placed in her letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moody handed the pocketbook to Isabel. &ldquo;There is the proof of your
      innocence,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thanks to the dog! Will you write and tell Mr.
      Hardyman what has happened?&rdquo; he asked, with his head down and his eyes on
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered him, with the bright color suddenly flowing over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> shall write to him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when the time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw her arms round his neck, and hid her face on his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;when I am your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A low growl from Tommie reminded them that he too had some claim to be
      noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel dropped on her knees, and saluted her old playfellow with the
      heartiest kisses she had ever given him since the day when their
      acquaintance began. &ldquo;You darling!&rdquo; she said, as she put him down again,
      &ldquo;what can I do to reward you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tommie rolled over on his back&mdash;more slowly than usual, in
      consequence of his luncheon in the tent. He elevated his four paws in the
      air and looked lazily at Isabel out of his bright brown eyes. If ever a
      dog&rsquo;s look spoke yet, Tommie&rsquo;s look said, &ldquo;I have eaten too much; rub my
      stomach.&rdquo;

      POSTSCRIPT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Persons of a speculative turn of mind are informed that the following
      document is for sale, and are requested to mention what sum they will give
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;IOU, Lady Lydiard, five hundred pounds (L500), Felix Sweetsir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her Ladyship became possessed of this pecuniary remittance under
      circumstances which surround it with a halo of romantic interest. It was
      the last communication she was destined to receive from her accomplished
      nephew. There was a Note attached to it, which cannot fail to enhance its
      value in the estimation of all right-minded persons who assist the
      circulation of paper money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lines that follow are strictly confidential:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Note.&mdash;Our excellent Moody informs me, my dear aunt, that you have
      decided (against his advice) on &lsquo;refusing to prosecute.&rsquo; I have not the
      slightest idea of what he means; but I am very much obliged to him,
      nevertheless, for reminding me of a circumstance which is of some interest
      to yourself personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am on the point of retiring to the Continent in search of health. One
      generally forgets something important when one starts on a journey. Before
      Moody called, I had entirely forgotten to mention that I had the pleasure
      of borrowing five hundred pounds of you some little time since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the occasion to which I refer, your language and manner suggested that
      you would not lend me the money if I asked for it. Obviously, the only
      course left was to take it without asking. I took it while Moody was gone
      to get some curacoa; and I returned to the picture-gallery in time to
      receive that delicious liqueur from the footman&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will naturally ask why I found it necessary to supply myself (if I
      may borrow an expression from the language of State finance) with this
      &lsquo;forced loan.&rsquo; I was actuated by motives which I think do me honor. My
      position at the time was critical in the extreme. My credit with the
      money-lenders was at an end; my friends had all turned their backs on me.
      I must either take the money or disgrace my family. If there is a man
      living who is sincerely attached to his family, I am that man. I took the
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conceive your position as my aunt (I say nothing of myself), if I had
      adopted the other alternative. Turned out of the Jockey Club, turned out
      of Tattersalls&rsquo;, turned out of the betting-ring; in short, posted publicly
      as a defaulter before the noblest institution in England, the Turf&mdash;and
      all for want of five hundred pounds to stop the mouth of the greatest
      brute I know of, Alfred Hardyman! Let me not harrow your feelings (and
      mine) by dwelling on it. Dear and admirable woman! To you belongs the
      honor of saving the credit of the family; I can claim nothing but the
      inferior merit of having offered you the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My IOU, it is needless to say, accompanies these lines. Can I do anything
      for you abroad?&mdash;F. S.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this it is only necessary to add (first) that Moody was perfectly right
      in believing F. S. to be the person who informed Hardyman&rsquo;s father of
      Isabel&rsquo;s position when she left Lady Lydiard&rsquo;s house; and (secondly) that
      Felix did really forward Mr. Troy&rsquo;s narrative of the theft to the French
      police, altering nothing in it but the number of the lost bank-note.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is there left to write about? Nothing is left&mdash;but to say
      good-by (very sorrowfully on the writer&rsquo;s part) to the Persons of the
      Story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good-by to Miss Pink&mdash;who will regret to her dying day that Isabel&rsquo;s
      answer to Hardyman was No.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good-by to Lady Lydiard&mdash;who differs with Miss Pink, and would have
      regretted it, to <i>her</i> dying day, if the answer had been Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good-by to Moody and Isabel&mdash;whose history has closed with the
      closing of the clergyman&rsquo;s book on their wedding-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good-by to Hardyman&mdash;who has sold his farm and his horses, and has
      begun a new life among the famous fast trotters of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good-by to Old Sharon&mdash;who, a martyr to his promise, brushed his hair
      and washed his face in honor of Moody&rsquo;s marriage; and catching a severe
      cold as the necessary consequence, declared, in the intervals of sneezing,
      that he would &ldquo;never do it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And last, not least, good-by to Tommie? No. The writer gave Tommie his
      dinner not half an hour since, and is too fond of him to say good-by.
    </p>
    <p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
